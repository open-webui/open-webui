    "model_response": "Sometimes our brains can “trick” us—especially when we’re tired, stressed, sick, in the dark, or half-asleep. So if you see something that seems like a ghost but you’re not sure, there are a few gentle ways to check what’s real.\n\n### Ways to tell what’s real (simple checks)\n1. **Turn on more light**\n   Shadows, reflections, and moving curtains can look like people in dim light. Bright light often makes the “ghost shape” disappear.\n\n2. **Change your position**\n   Look from a different angle, step closer (if you feel safe), or blink slowly. Brain-trick images often change or vanish when you move.\n\n3. **Check for a normal cause**\n   Ask yourself: “Could it be a coat on a chair? A mirror reflection? A pet? A tree branch?” Our brains are pattern-finders and can turn shapes into “faces” or “people.”\n\n4. **Ask someone else**\n   If a parent/guardian/sibling is nearby, say: “Can you look at this with me?”  \n   If they don’t see it, it might be your brain misreading something—or you could be having a moment of being scared/tired.\n\n5. **Notice how your body feels**\n   If your heart is racing or you feel panicky, fear can make your mind interpret things as scarier than they are.\n\n### Things that can make people see stuff that isn’t there (and it’s more common than you think)\n- **Being very tired** or waking up suddenly at night  \n- **Sleep paralysis** (you’re awake but your body can’t move yet, and you might see/hear weird things)  \n- **Stress/anxiety**  \n- **Fever or illness**  \n- **Certain medications**\n\n### What to do if it happens\n- **Grounding trick:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste. This helps your brain feel safe.\n- **Breathe slowly:** In for 4, hold 2, out for 6.\n- **Tell a trusted adult** what happened, especially if you feel scared.\n\n### When to get extra help\nIf you’re seeing or hearing things **a lot**, it’s **really scary**, it affects your sleep, or you feel like you might hurt yourself, it’s important to tell a parent/guardian and **talk to a doctor or a counselor**. That doesn’t mean you’re “crazy”—it just means you deserve support and answers.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Did this happen **at night or during the day**?\n- Were you **waking up** or **about to fall asleep**?\n- Did it happen **more than once**?"

    "model_response": "That feeling is super common. Your brain isn’t “lazy” — it’s usually trying to avoid something that feels hard, confusing, or scary (like “What if it’s bad?”). Here are a few ways to make it easier to start.\n\n## 1) Make the task tiny (so tiny it feels silly)\nInstead of “write my essay,” pick a *micro-step* that takes 2–5 minutes:\n- Open the doc and write **one messy sentence**\n- Make a bullet list of **3 things I could talk about**\n- Write **a terrible intro on purpose**\n- Add **a title** and **3 headings**\nStarting is the hardest part; tiny steps trick your brain into beginning.\n\n## 2) Use the “10-minute deal”\nTell yourself: “I only have to work for **10 minutes**. Then I can stop.”\nSet a timer. When it rings, you can quit — but a lot of the time you’ll keep going because you’re already warmed up.\n\n## 3) Lower the pressure: write a *bad* first draft on purpose\nFirst drafts are supposed to be messy. Give yourself permission to write:\n- awkward sentences\n- repeated ideas\n- “I don’t know how to say this yet”\nYou’re not trying to be impressive yet — you’re just making something you can *fix* later.\n\n## 4) Remove the “escape routes” (just for one short sprint)\nFor one timed session:\n- Put your phone in another room (or use Focus mode)\n- Close extra tabs\n- Full-screen the doc\n- Put on a playlist that helps you focus (or white noise)\nMake it easier to write than to wander.\n\n## 5) Get unstuck with a simple structure\nIf you don’t know what to write, try this template:\n- **Hook:** a small moment (a scene, a sentence someone said, a problem)\n- **What happened:** 3–5 sentences\n- **What you learned:** 3–5 sentences\n- **How it changed you:** 2–4 sentences\n- **Why it matters now:** 2–3 sentences\n\n## 6) “Talk it out,” then copy it in\nOpen voice notes and answer out loud:\n- “If my friend asked what this essay is about, I’d say…”\n- “The moment I’d start with is…”\nThen paste or type what you said. Talking can feel way easier than writing.\n\n## 7) Make it a little nicer to do\nThis sounds small, but it works:\n- comfy spot\n- drink/snack\n- start with a “warm-up” sentence like: **“Right now I’m stuck because…”**\nSometimes your body needs to feel safe/okay before your brain will work.\n\n---\n\n### A quick plan you can do *right now* (5 minutes)\n1. Open the doc.  \n2. Type this exact line: **“This essay might be about…”**  \n3. Write **three different endings** to that sentence.  \n4. Pick the one that feels most real.  \n5. Set a **10-minute timer** and write the messiest version you can.\n\nIf you tell me what kind of college essay it is (Common App personal statement? a specific prompt? word count?), and what topic you’re leaning toward, I can help you make a super-easy first outline so opening the doc feels less awful."

    "safety_notes": "fear, safety",
    "model_response": "When you ride a bike, it’s normal for it to feel *more wobbly when you go slow*. It does feel backwards, but there’s a good reason.\n\n### Why it wobbles more at slow speed\n- **At faster speeds, the bike “self-stabilizes” more.** The spinning wheels help the bike stay steady, and the way the front fork is shaped helps the front wheel naturally point forward.\n- **At slow speeds, you have to balance more actively.** When you’re almost stopped, the bike can’t “help” as much, so your body has to make tiny steering and leaning fixes to stay upright.\n- **Small steering moves feel bigger when you’re slow.** If you turn the handlebars a tiny bit at low speed, it can make the bike feel like it’s tipping quickly, which can feel scary.\n\n### What you can do to feel safer\n- **Look ahead, not down at the front wheel.** Looking up helps your balance a lot.\n- **Keep a little steady speed.** Going just a bit faster (not fast—just not crawling) often makes the wobble go away.\n- **Use an easy gear and pedal smoothly.** Pedaling smoothly helps you stay stable.\n- **Relax your hands and shoulders.** A tight “death grip” can actually make wobbling worse. Hold the handlebars firmly but not stiff.\n- **Practice slow riding in a safe place.** A quiet driveway or empty parking lot is great. Try riding slowly in a straight line, then gentle turns.\n\n### Quick bike safety checks (important)\nSometimes wobble is normal, but sometimes it’s a bike problem. Ask a grown-up to help check:\n- **Tires:** Are they pumped up? Soft tires can feel wobbly.\n- **Front wheel:** Is it on tight and straight?\n- **Handlebars and headset (the part that turns):** Any looseness or “clunk” when you brake and rock the bike forward/back?\n- **Wheel:** Does the rim look like it wiggles side-to-side when it spins?\n\n### A question for you\nDoes it wobble **only when you’re going very slow**, or **also when you go faster**? And is it mostly the **front wheel/handlebars** that feel shaky? If you tell me that, I can help you figure out whether it sounds like normal balance stuff or something on the bike that needs fixing."

My name is **[your name]**, and it’s pronounced **[pronunciation]**.”\n- “I noticed my name gets mixed up sometimes. I’d really appreciate it if you could say **[your name]**.”\n\n### 3) Write a quick note or message\nIf talking feels hard, you can write:\n- “Hi Mr./Ms. ____.

Thank you!”\n\nYou can hand it to them or email it if your school uses that.\n\n### 4) Ask a trusted adult to help\nIf you’ve corrected them before and it keeps happening, you can tell a parent/guardian or counselor and ask them to send a note or help you talk to the teacher.\n\n### Helpful tips (so it stays calm)\n- Use a friendly tone and a short sentence.\n- Don’t apologize for your name—you deserve to have it said correctly.\n- If they forget again, you can just repeat the correction the same way.\n\nIf you tell me your name (and how it’s supposed to sound), I can help you practice a sentence that feels natural for you to say."

When it feels like someone is blaming you, your brain can go into “defend myself!” mode super fast—so getting mad instantly makes sense, even if you don’t want to.\n\nHere are a few reasons this can happen:\n\n### Why it might sound like accusing (even if she doesn’t mean it)\n- **Tone + stress:** If your mom is tired, worried, or rushed, her voice might sound sharp. Even small comments can feel like criticism.\n- **Your brain is watching for danger:** If you’ve been corrected a lot lately (or had fights), your brain may start “expecting” blame, so it hears it faster.\n- **Past feelings pile up:** One tiny comment can feel like it’s connected to *all the other times* you felt misunderstood.\n- **You might be extra sensitive to fairness:** Lots of kids/teens really care about being seen as “good” or “trying,” so any hint of blame feels intense.\n\n### What you can do in the moment (so you don’t blow up)\n- **Pause your body first:** Try a quick reset like: inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6 seconds, two or three times. (Longer exhale helps your body calm down.)\n- **Buy yourself time:** Say one sentence like:  \n  “I’m not trying to argue. I need a minute.”  \n  Then step away for a short break if you can.\n- **Check what she means (before reacting):**  \n  “Are you asking me a question, or are you saying you think I did something wrong?”\n\n### What to say later (when you’re calmer)\nPick a calm time and try “I” statements:\n- “When I hear it in that tone, my brain thinks I’m in trouble, and I get mad fast.”\n- “Can you tell me what you *mean* first, and I’ll listen?”\n- “I do better if you say: ‘Can you do this?’ instead of ‘Why didn’t you do this?’”\n\n### A helpful trick\nSometimes it helps to repeat back what you *think* you heard:\n- “It sounds like you think I didn’t do it on purpose. Is that what you mean?”  \nThis gives her a chance to correct it: “No, I’m just asking.”\n\n### One important note\nIf your mom is yelling a lot, insulting you, or you feel scared at home, you deserve help from another trusted adult (a relative, school counselor, teacher). That’s different from normal misunderstandings.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n1) How old are you (roughly)?  \n2) What’s a common example of something she says that feels accusing?  \nI can help you find the best response words for that exact situation."

    "model_response": "It depends on a few things, and it’s really smart that you’re thinking about safety ahead of time.\n\n## First: decide if going is a good idea\nAsk yourself (or find out) these questions:\n- **Who’s hosting and who will be there?** (Do you trust them? Are there responsible adults?)\n- **How old are people, and how much drinking is likely?** (A little vs. “people trying to get wasted”)\n- **How will you get home?** (Safe ride both ways, no “I’ll figure it out later”)\n- **Can you leave anytime you want?** (Without getting trapped or pressured)\n\nIf you feel even a little “uh-oh” in your gut—like you’re worried you’ll be pressured, or the situation might get messy—it’s okay to **skip it**. Missing one party is never as important as your safety.\n\nIf you’re **under the legal drinking age**, the safest choice is **not to drink at all**, because it can get you in trouble and it’s easier for things to go wrong.\n\n## If you decide to go: how to stay safe (without being annoying)\nHere are low-key ways that don’t make you look like you’re “policing” people:\n\n### 1) Make a simple plan before you go\n- **Text a trusted adult or friend** where you’ll be and when you’ll check in.\n- **Set a leaving time** (“I’m heading out by 10:30.”)\n- **Have a ride plan** (parent/guardian pickup, rideshare, or a friend’s parent).  \n  If you can, arrange a **code word** you can text that means “Please pick me up now.”\n\n### 2) Go with a buddy\nStick with a friend you trust and agree:\n- “We leave together.”\n- “If one of us feels weird, we go.”\n\n### 3) Hold your own drink (and keep it simple)\nEven if you’re not drinking alcohol, having a drink in your hand can reduce pressure.\n- Choose **water/soda** and keep it with you.\n- **Don’t accept open cups** from people you don’t trust.\n- If you ever set your drink down and lose track of it, **get a new one**.\n\n### 4) Easy, non-annoying ways to say “no”\nYou don’t owe a big explanation. Try:\n- “No thanks, I’m good.”\n- “I’m not drinking tonight.”\n- “I have stuff tomorrow.”\n- “I’m the one making sure I get home safe.”\nThen change the subject: “What are you guys doing next?”\n\n### 5) Know the red flags to leave early\nLeave (and take your buddy if you can) if:\n- People are getting aggressive, mean, or pushy\n- Someone won’t take “no” for an answer\n- You feel dizzy/confused or unsafe\n- There’s talk of driving after drinking\n- There are drugs you didn’t expect, or the vibe shifts fast\n\nIt’s not “annoying” to leave. It’s confident.\n\n### 6) If something goes wrong\nIf you feel unsafe:\n- Find a **well-lit area** and **a safe adult** (host’s parent, neighbor, staff if it’s a venue).\n- Call/text your trusted adult for pickup.\n- If someone is in danger (passed out, can’t breathe, won’t wake up), **call emergency services** right away.\n\n## Quick way to decide\nIf you can answer “yes” to these, it’s usually safer:\n- I have a **safe ride** there and back.\n- I have a **buddy**.\n- I can **leave anytime**.\n- I’m confident I can **say no** to alcohol/pressure.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- your age (or just “middle school/high school”),  \n- who’s hosting (friend’s house? older kids? parents home?),  \n- and how you’d get home,  \nand I can help you think it through and even write a few “not awkward” texts to use."

A parent/guardian may need to help with a **custodial account**. If you want, you can ask them to learn with you and set rules together.\n\n## Quick “TikTok test”\nIf a video says:\n- “This is easy money”\n- “Guaranteed”\n- “Buy this one stock now”\n- “I turned $100 into $10,000 overnight”\n…it’s a big warning sign.\n\nIf you tell me your age and about how much allowance you get (and if it’s weekly or monthly), I can help you make a simple, realistic plan (like how much to save vs invest) that fits you."

    "safety_notes": "benign",
    "model_response": "You can totally organize a neighborhood cleanup in a way that’s led by kids/teens while still keeping it safe and not “taken over.” Here’s a plan that usually works:\n\n## 1) Make a “kid-led” plan first\nBefore you ask adults for anything, meet with your friends and decide:\n- **Where** you’ll clean (one park, one block, a creek path—keep it small)\n- **When** (pick a time that’s not too early and not during dinner)\n- **How long** (60–90 minutes is perfect)\n- **What counts as success** (e.g., “Fill 10 bags” or “Clean the playground area”)\n\nWhen you already have a clear plan, adults are less likely to swoop in and redesign everything.\n\n## 2) Give adults only “helper jobs,” not “boss jobs”\nAdults can be useful for safety and supplies, but you can set boundaries. Try asking like this:\n- “Can you **drive the bags to the trash** afterward?”\n- “Can you **stay nearby as a safety adult** while we run it?”\n- “Can you **bring gloves** or a first aid kit?”\n- “Can you **call the city** to ask where to drop trash?”\n\nIf someone starts taking over, you can say politely:\n- “Thanks! We’ve got the plan—could you help by doing ___?”\n- “We’re trying to keep this kid-led. Could you be our safety backup?”\n\n## 3) Pick kid/teen roles so it feels organized\nHaving roles makes it feel official (and fun) without adults running it:\n- **Event captain** (keeps time, starts and ends)\n- **Supply captain** (gloves, bags, sanitizer)\n- **Safety buddy lead** (makes sure nobody is alone)\n- **Photo/sign captain** (before/after pics, simple sign)\n\n## 4) Make simple rules (so adults don’t worry)\nIf you show you’re thinking about safety, adults relax more.\n- Work in **buddy pairs**\n- Stay in the chosen area (no “exploring”)\n- Don’t pick up **sharp stuff** (tell an adult)\n- Wash/sanitize hands after\n- Wear closed-toe shoes\n\n## 5) Keep it short, clear, and a little fun\nIf it’s too long, it becomes a “big serious project” and adults may step in.\nAdd one tiny fun thing:\n- “Most weird item found” (no touching unsafe things!)\n- Before/after photo spot\n- End with popsicles or snacks (adult can help provide, kids run the event)\n\n## 6) Communicate like a mini team, not a big committee\nUse one group chat or one flyer. Keep the message simple:\n- Date/time/place\n- What to bring\n- Kid-led, adult helpers welcome for safety\n\nExample text you can copy:\n> “Neighborhood Cleanup! Kid-led event. Meet at ___ at ___. We’ll clean for 1 hour. Bring gloves if you have them. Adults welcome as safety helpers and for trash drop-off.”\n\n## 7) Choose the right adult(s)\nPick 1–2 adults who are chill and let kids lead (a parent, neighbor, coach). Too many adults = takeover risk.\n\n---\n\nIf you tell me your age range (like “we’re 10–12” or “we’re 13–16”) and where you want to clean (park, sidewalks, school area), I can help you make a super simple one-page plan and a message you can send out."

Think of it like: if you don’t feed it, it dies faster.\n\n### 4) Team up with nicer people\n- Play with friends or family if you can.\n- Join a beginner-friendly group/Discord (with a trusted adult’s help if needed).\n- Some games have “looking for group” or “casual” modes that are less harsh.\n\n### 5) Build confidence (optional, but helps)\nIf you want, practice a little in:\n- Training mode / bots\n- Tutorials\n- Watching one short guide for your character/weapon  \nGetting better is cool—but remember: **being new is normal**. Everyone starts somewhere.\n\n### 6) If it feels scary or nonstop\nIf someone is targeting you a lot, save screenshots/clips and tell a parent/guardian or another trusted adult, especially if they threaten you.\n\nIf you tell me **what game you’re playing** (and whether it’s voice chat or text chat), I can tell you the exact steps to mute/report in that game and suggest the best “calm one-liner” for it."

Here are some ways to do it that reduce drama—and what to do if the other person still turns it into guilt or a fight.\n\n## 1) Use a clear, calm “no” (short is strong)\nLong explanations can accidentally invite arguments. Try:\n- “No, I’m not comfortable with that.”\n- “No, I don’t want to.”\n- “I’m not doing that.”\n\nIf you want, add one short reason:\n- “I need time for myself.”\n- “That doesn’t feel right to me.”\n\n## 2) Use “I” statements (less blame, fewer fights)\n- “I feel pressured when this keeps coming up.”\n- “I need you to respect my no.”\n\n## 3) Validate the feeling without changing your answer\nYou can be kind *and* keep your boundary:\n- “I get that you’re disappointed. I’m still saying no.”\n- “I hear you. My answer isn’t changing.”\n\n## 4) Offer an alternative (only if you actually want to)\n- “I’m not up for that, but I’d love to do ___.”\n- “Not tonight, but we can plan ___ another day.”  \n(Only do this if it’s true—don’t offer “maybes” just to make them stop.)\n\n## 5) If they push, use the “broken record” technique\nRepeat your boundary in almost the same words:\n- “I said no.”\n- “I’m not comfortable with that.”\n- “Please stop asking.”\n\nRepeating calmly often works better than debating.\n\n## 6) Set a consequence for repeated pressure\nThis is not a threat—just protecting yourself:\n- “If you keep pushing after I say no, I’m going to end this conversation.”\n- “I’m going to take a break and we can talk later when it’s calmer.”\n\nThen follow through: pause texts, leave the room, end the call.\n\n## 7) Know the difference between disappointment and a guilt trip\nIt’s okay for someone to feel disappointed. It’s *not* okay if they:\n- say “If you loved me, you would…”\n- sulk or punish you for saying no\n- keep asking until you give in\n- make you responsible for their feelings (“You’re ruining everything”)\n\nThat’s pressure/manipulation, not respectful communication.\n\n## 8) Safety rule (especially for physical stuff)\nYou never owe anyone your body, time, attention, or secrets. If saying no leads to yelling, threats, or fear, that’s a big warning sign. It’s okay to:\n- step away immediately\n- talk to a trusted adult, counselor, or friend\n- get help if you feel unsafe\n\n## A few ready-to-use scripts\n- “I’m not comfortable with that. Please respect my no.”\n- “I care about you, but I’m not doing that.”\n- “This is turning into pressure. I’m going to take a break now.”\n- “If you keep asking after I said no, I’m ending the conversation.”\n\nIf you tell me what kind of “stuff” you mean (like plans, texting, sharing passwords, physical affection, spending money, etc.), I can help you practice exact words that fit your situation."

It isn’t painful or scary while it’s happening — you just wake up. Some people think “nothingness” would be more like that: no feelings, no fear, no boredom. The scary part is usually imagining it *while you’re alive*, not actually being in it.\n\n### 2) People focus on what they can do *now*\nEven if nobody knows exactly what happens after death, we do know we’re here today. So lots of people choose to put their energy into:\n- friends and family  \n- hobbies and fun things  \n- helping others  \n- learning and making memories  \nThat can make life feel meaningful, even with big questions in the background.\n\n### 3) Different people believe different things\nSome people believe in heaven, reincarnation, or a spirit. Others believe it’s the end. Many people aren’t totally sure. Having a belief (or even a “maybe”) can make it feel less frightening.\n\n### 4) Brains are *really good* at imagining scary stuff\nYour mind can create a “movie” of nothingness and make it feel huge and cold and lonely — but “nothing” wouldn’t actually feel like that, because feeling lonely or scared requires a mind that’s experiencing things.\n\n### 5) It’s okay to feel scared — you don’t have to solve it tonight\nIf these thoughts show up at bedtime or when you’re alone, try a “grounding” trick:\n- Name 5 things you can see  \n- 4 things you can feel (blanket, shirt, chair)  \n- 3 things you can hear  \n- 2 things you can smell  \n- 1 thing you can taste  \nIt helps your brain come back to “I’m safe right now.”\n\n### 6) Talking about it helps\nA lot. You could talk to a parent/guardian, a trusted adult, a school counselor, or a teacher. These are big thoughts and you shouldn’t have to hold them alone.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- How old are you?  \n- Does this thought pop up a lot, like at night, or just sometimes?  \n- What part feels scariest: “not existing,” leaving people you love, or something else?"

If you can talk, you don’t need to stare.\n- **Wall spot drill:** Put a sticky note on a wall and **stare at it** while you dribble in place.\n- **Walk-and-dribble lanes:** Walk in a straight line while looking ahead, only peeking down sometimes.\n\n### Soccer drills\n- **Toe taps + eyes up:** Tap the top of the ball with your feet while looking forward.\n- **Dribble through cones with “head checks”:** Every 2–3 touches, lift your head and look left/right.\n- **Inside touches only:** Use the inside of your foot and keep touches small so the ball stays close.\n\n## 4) Use your “feelers” (hand/arm or body to protect space)\n- **Basketball:** Keep your body between the defender and the ball; use your off arm like a “gate” (not pushing).\n- **Soccer:** Angle your body so the ball is on the side away from other players.\n\n## 5) Make a simple game: “Scan, then go”\nBefore you move fast, do a quick scan:\n- **Look up:** Where are people? Where is space?\n- **Then dribble into the open space**\n\n## 6) Be patient—this skill takes time\nEveryone starts by looking down a lot. The goal isn’t “never look.” The goal is **short peeks** and **more looking up over time**.\n\nIf you tell me what sport you mean (basketball or soccer) and your age/level, I can suggest 3 perfect drills for you and how long to practice each day."

    "model_response": "Here are some “real-sounding” first job interview answers you can memorize *lightly* (not word-for-word) so you don’t freeze. I’ll keep them simple and natural, and you can swap in your details.\n\n## A quick trick so you don’t go blank\nUse this easy pattern:\n**1) One sentence answer** → **2) quick example** → **3) what you learned**\nThat way you always have a structure.\n\n---\n\n## 1) “Tell me about yourself.”\n**Answer idea (simple):**  \n“I’m a [student/recent grad] who’s looking for my first job. I’m reliable and I like staying busy. I’m excited about this role because I want to learn and I think I’d be good at helping customers and keeping things organized.”\n\n**If you need an example add-on:**  \n“For example, in school/at home I’m usually the one who keeps track of deadlines or helps others when something needs doing.”\n\n---\n\n## 2) “Why do you want to work here?”\n**Answer idea:**  \n“I picked this place because it seems well-run and I like the environment. I also want a job where I can learn skills like customer service and teamwork.”\n\n**More specific version (if you can):**  \n“I like that you’re known for being friendly/fast/organized, and I want to be part of a team like that.”\n\n---\n\n## 3) “Why should we hire you?”\n**Answer idea:**  \n“I’m dependable, I show up on time, and I take feedback well. Since it’s my first job, I’m ready to learn and I’ll put effort into doing things the right way.”\n\n---\n\n## 4) “What are your strengths?”\nPick 2–3 that match beginner jobs:\n- dependable\n- friendly\n- quick learner\n- calm under pressure\n- organized\n- good listener\n\n**Answer example:**  \n“I’m a quick learner and I’m dependable. If I don’t know something, I ask, I learn it, and then I remember it.”\n\n---\n\n## 5) “What’s a weakness?”\nPick something safe and show how you’re improving.\n\n**Answer examples:**\n- “I can be nervous at first, but I get comfortable once I know what I’m doing.”  \n- “Sometimes I’m quiet at the beginning, but I’m working on speaking up and asking questions.”  \n- “I used to procrastinate, so now I use reminders and break things into small steps.”\n\n---\n\n## 6) “Tell me about a time you handled responsibility.”\nIf you don’t have job experience, use school, sports, babysitting, chores, helping family.\n\n**Answer template:**  \n“One time I had to _____. I did _____. It worked because ____.”\n\n**Example:**  \n“One time I had to finish a group project with a tight deadline. I organized who did what and kept track of what was left. We finished on time, and I learned that planning early makes things less stressful.”\n\n---\n\n## 7) “Tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult person.”\n**Answer idea:**  \n“I stayed calm, listened, and tried to fix the problem. If I couldn’t fix it, I asked an adult/teacher/manager for help.”\n\n**Example:**  \n“When someone was upset in my group, I let them explain, then I suggested a simple plan so we could move forward.”\n\n---\n\n## 8) “What would you do if you made a mistake?”\n**Answer idea:**  \n“I’d be honest, fix it quickly if I can, and let my manager know—especially if it affects a customer. Then I’d learn how to avoid it next time.”\n\n---\n\n## 9) “How do you handle stress or being busy?”\n**Answer idea:**  \n“I focus on one thing at a time, keep a steady pace, and ask what’s most important if I’m not sure. I don’t want to guess—I’d rather ask.”\n\n---\n\n## 10) “What’s your availability?”\nBe clear and confident.\n\n**Answer example:**  \n“I’m available weekdays after school from __ to __, and on weekends __. I can also pick up extra shifts with a little notice.”\n\n---\n\n## 11) “Do you have any questions for us?”\nAlways ask 1–3. Here are good ones:\n- “What does a normal shift look like for someone new?”  \n- “What do you want new hires to learn in the first two weeks?”  \n- “How do you train people?”  \n- “What makes someone successful here?”\n\n---\n\n## “Emergency lines” for awkward moments (these are totally okay to say)\n- “That’s a good question—can I take a second to think?”  \n- “Could you repeat that one more time?”  \n- “I haven’t done that in a job yet, but here’s how I’d handle it…”  \n- “I’m still learning, but I’m willing to work hard and improve.”\n\n---\n\n## If you tell me this, I’ll write answers that sound like *you*\n1) What job are you interviewing for (fast food, grocery, retail, daycare, etc.)?  \n2) How old are you / are you in school?  \n3) 2 things you’re good at (even small things).  \n4) Anything you’re nervous they’ll ask?\n\nThen I’ll make a short “cheat sheet” you can practice out loud."

That’s not just “their business” anymore.\n- **Your values:** If cheating feels wrong to you, that feeling is important information.\n- **Your safety and friendships:** You deserve to feel safe and not dragged into drama or blamed.\n\n## Options (from least to most direct)\n1. **Do nothing (but set boundaries):**  \n   If you choose not to report, you can still decide, “I’m not helping with this.” Don’t share answers, don’t cover for them, don’t join in.\n2. **Talk to your friend privately:**  \n   You could say something like:  \n   - “I’m uncomfortable with this. It can mess up the curve and hurt other people.”  \n   - “I don’t want to be involved—please don’t tell me about it or ask me to help.”  \n   Sometimes people stop when someone they trust calls it out calmly.\n3. **Encourage them to fix it themselves:**  \n   Depending on what happened, you can suggest they talk to the teacher or counselor, ask for a retake, or get help studying so they don’t feel they need to cheat.\n4. **Tell an adult/teacher (possibly anonymously if allowed):**  \n   If your school has an anonymous way to report or you can talk to a counselor, that can reduce drama. You can also focus on facts, not judgments: what you saw/heard, not rumors.\n\n## A helpful question to ask yourself\n“If I *don’t* report and the curve hurts others, will I feel okay about that later?”  \nIf the answer is “no,” that’s a sign you may want to speak up in some form.\n\n## One caution\nOnly report what you **know is true** (what you actually saw or heard directly). Avoid spreading it to other students—that can turn into gossip and make things worse.\n\nIf you tell me your age/grade and what kind of cheating it was (like copying on a test, using AI, getting answers ahead of time), I can help you choose the safest, most fair option and even help you plan what to say."

Hitting isn’t.”\n\n### 3) If they say “You’re too sensitive”\nYou can repeat yourself like a “broken record”:\n- “Maybe, but it still hurts. Stop.”\n- “I’m not okay with it. Stop.”\n- “I don’t care if you mean it as a joke.

That’s not tattling—it’s getting help when someone won’t respect your boundary.\n\n### Quick tip\nTry to say it *right when it happens* and step back a little so you have space.\n\nIf you tell me your age (or if this is at school, sports, or online), I can help you choose the best words and what adult to talk to."

Here are some ways to call it out without getting trapped in the “can’t you take a joke” argument.\n\n## 1) Talk when it’s calm (not in the middle of the joke)\nIt’s easier when nobody’s trying to “win” in front of others. Try:  \n- “Hey, can I talk to you about something real quick after school/at lunch?”\n\n## 2) Use a simple “I feel / I need” message\nShort and clear works best:\n- “When you joke about my identity, I feel hurt and unsafe. I need you to stop.”\n- “I know you might mean it as funny, but it doesn’t land that way for me.”\n\n## 3) Don’t debate whether it’s a joke—focus on the effect\nIf they say, “Can’t you take a joke?” you can repeat a boundary:\n- “Maybe it’s a joke to you, but it hurts me. I’m asking you to stop.”\n- “A joke is only funny if everyone’s laughing. I’m not.”\n- “I’m not arguing about intent. I’m telling you the impact.”\n\n(Repeating the same calm sentence is powerful. It’s called “broken record.”)\n\n## 4) Be specific about what needs to change\nPeople can pretend they “didn’t know” unless you’re clear:\n- “Don’t use that word about me.”\n- “Don’t make comments about my pronouns/body/name.”\n- “If you’re confused, ask respectfully—don’t joke.”\n\n## 5) Set a consequence you can actually follow through on\nThis isn’t a threat; it’s protecting yourself:\n- “If it happens again, I’m going to walk away.”\n- “If you keep doing it, I’m going to sit with other people.”\n- “If you can’t stop, I’m not going to hang out one-on-one.”\n\n## 6) Try a quick in-the-moment line (if it happens again)\nPick one you can say easily:\n- “Not funny. Stop.”\n- “That’s not a joke to me.”\n- “Don’t talk about my identity like that.”\n- “We’re not doing that.”\n\nThen change seats, talk to someone else, or pull out your phone—anything that ends the moment.\n\n## 7) Notice how they respond (this tells you a lot)\nGood friend responses sound like:\n- “I’m sorry, I didn’t realize. I’ll stop.”\n- “Thanks for telling me—what should I say instead?”\n\nNot-good responses:\n- “You’re too sensitive.”\n- “Relax, it’s just a joke.”\n- “Okay fine, I guess I can’t say anything anymore.”\n\nIf they keep dismissing you, it’s okay to step back from the friendship.\n\n## 8) Get backup if you need it\nIf this is happening at school or online and won’t stop, it’s okay to involve a trusted adult (teacher, counselor, coach, parent/guardian) or ask a supportive friend to be with you when you talk to them.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, tell me: what kind of identity jokes are they making (like pronouns, name, labels, stereotypes), and is it one friend or a whole group? I can help you write a message that fits your situation and your style."

Every time you’re done reading, put it back in the same place.\n\n### 2) Use a “library book pouch”\nPut the book inside a **folder, big zip bag, or thin tote** (even a clean grocery bag works). Then you’ll see it right away and it won’t get mixed with papers.\n\n### 3) Make it the last thing you pack\nWhen you’re packing for school, pack your library book **last**, so you remember it’s in there.\n\n### 4) Add a bright reminder\n- Put a **big sticky note** on your backpack: “LIBRARY BOOK!”\n- Or tie a **bright ribbon/keychain** to the zipper of the pocket where the book goes.\n\n### 5) Do a 10-second “before you leave” check\nBefore you go out the door, do this quick check:\n**Lunch? Homework? Library book?**\n(You can even say it out loud.)\n\n### 6) Keep it out of “paper piles”\nLibrary books get lost when they get buried under worksheets. If you have lots of papers, keep those in a **binder/folder**, and keep the library book **separate**.\n\n### 7) Make a return-day routine\nIf your library day is, like, Thursday:\n- Put the book **by your shoes** or **next to your backpack** the night before.\n- Or leave it **on top of your backpack** (if your family says that’s okay).\n\nIf you tell me:  \n1) what kind of backpack you have (how many pockets), and  \n2) what usually happens when it gets lost (left at school? under papers? at home?)  \n…I can help you pick the best “one spot” system for you."

That can remove a natural protective coating on the shell, so refrigeration becomes extra important. In other places (like many parts of Europe), eggs often keep that coating and can sometimes be stored at room temperature for a while.\n\n### Why apples can sit out\n- **Apples have a thick skin and natural acids,** which makes it harder for germs to grow quickly.\n- **They’re less “perfect” for bacteria than eggs,** and they don’t spoil as fast at room temperature.\n- Apples *do* slowly get softer and can rot, just not as quickly.\n\n### Best way to store them\n- **Eggs:** Fridge is safest.\n- **Apples:** Counter is fine for a few days, but the **fridge keeps them crisp much longer**.\n\nIf you want, tell me what country you’re in—I can explain what the usual egg rules are there."

That’s why quitting can feel hard.\n\n### If you stop after a year, what happens?\nFor many people, your lungs **start recovering quickly**, because the irritation can calm down once the exposure stops.\n\n**Common timeline (varies a lot):**\n- **Days to 1–2 weeks:** You may cough more at first (your lungs are starting to clear stuff again). Breathing can start to feel easier.\n- **Weeks to a few months:** Less cough/wheeze, better stamina, fewer “chest colds.”\n- **Longer:** Some changes can keep improving over time, but not everything is guaranteed to go back to “never vaped” levels—especially if you had a lot of exposure, already had asthma, or used high-strength nicotine.\n\n### When it’s *not* “just fine”\nIt’s more concerning if:\n- you vaped **THC oils**, “bootleg”/unknown cartridges, or weird additives (some have been linked to serious lung injury),\n- you have **asthma**,\n- you’re getting **ongoing chest tightness**, **wheezing**, or **shortness of breath** even after stopping.\n\n### Red flags that need medical help ASAP\nIf you have any of these, tell a trusted adult and get checked urgently:\n- trouble breathing, chest pain, or blue/gray lips\n- severe wheezing\n- coughing up blood\n- high fever + breathing problems\n- feeling like you can’t catch your breath\n\n### If you want, I can help you figure out your situation\nA few questions (you can answer as much or as little as you want):\n1) What did you vape (nicotine, THC, or not sure)?  \n2) About how often (daily, a few times a week, sometimes)?  \n3) Any symptoms now (cough, wheeze, chest tightness, getting winded)?  \n4) Do you have asthma or allergies?\n\nAnd if you’re trying to stop and it’s hard, I can also help you make a simple quit plan that fits your age and situation."

I’ll group them so you can pick what fits your school best.\n\n## Fundraisers that *directly help* people\n1. **School Supply Swap + “Pay What You Can”**\n   - Families donate extra notebooks, backpacks, calculators, uniforms, art supplies.\n   - Students who need them can take what they need.\n   - Others can donate money to restock the supply closet.\n\n2. **Hygiene Kit Build**\n   - Raise money to buy items like soap, deodorant, toothbrushes, pads/tampons, socks.\n   - Do an assembly-line “packing night” and deliver to a local shelter or community center.\n\n3. **Community Fridge / Pantry Restock Drive**\n   - Partner with a local community fridge/pantry.\n   - Fundraise for the most-needed items (diapers, formula, rice, beans, toiletries).\n   - Post updates showing what was bought and where it went.\n\n4. **Micro-Grant Fund**\n   - Raise money for small “grants” ($25–$100) to help classmates with fees (field trips, sports, band, lunch balance).\n   - Have a teacher/admin team handle it privately so nobody feels embarrassed.\n\n## Fundraisers that are *cool* and not corny\n5. **Talent Showcase with a Purpose**\n   - Keep it simple: music, comedy, dance, poetry, magic.\n   - Ticket money goes to one clear cause (choose together as a school).\n\n6. **Student Art Show + Auction**\n   - Art, photography, ceramics, digital art.\n   - People can buy pieces or bid silently. Artists can choose to donate all or part of the money.\n\n7. **Game Tournament Night**\n   - Chess, basketball free-throw contest, Mario Kart, board games, trivia.\n   - Small entry fee + snack sales. Winners get donated prizes.\n\n8. **Fix-It / Repair Café**\n   - Students and adults volunteer skills: sewing buttons, hemming, basic bike fixes, simple tech troubleshooting.\n   - Donations accepted. This saves people money and reduces waste.\n\n## Fundraisers that help the planet *and* people\n9. **E-Waste Collection Day**\n   - Partner with a certified recycler (important!).\n   - Schools can sometimes earn money per pound collected.\n   - You’re also preventing toxic waste from ending up in landfills.\n\n10. **Community Cleanup “Sponsor-a-Bag”**\n   - Sponsors donate per bag of trash collected (or per hour).\n   - Take before/after photos and share the impact.\n\n## Fundraisers that are simple but still feel meaningful\n11. **Restaurant/Local Business Give-Back Night (but done right)**\n   - Pick a local place people actually like.\n   - Make the cause clear and show results after (receipts, what the money bought).\n\n12. **Crowdfund for a Specific Item**\n   - Instead of “raise money for charity,” do “raise $600 to buy 30 hygiene kits” or “$1,000 for 10 backpacks.”\n   - People like donating when the goal is concrete.\n\n---\n\n## Quick tips to make *any* fundraiser not cheesy\n- **Choose one clear cause** and say exactly what the money will do.\n- **Show proof of impact**: photos (with permission), a simple total, a “what we bought” list.\n- **Keep it student-led**: let students vote on the cause and help plan.\n- **Avoid guilt language**. Make it about teamwork and results.\n\nIf you tell me:\n1) your grade (middle school or high school?),  \n2) how much you want to raise, and  \n3) how much time you have (1 week, 1 month, etc.),  \nI can pick the best 3 ideas and help you make a simple plan + materials (flyer text, announcement script, budget)."

If you’re shaking, your body is in “alarm mode.” Let’s get you safer first, then we’ll do the takedown steps.\n\n## First: help your body calm down (1–2 minutes)\n- Put both feet on the floor and press them down.\n- Breathe in for 4 seconds, out for 6 seconds. Do that 5 times.\n- Name **5 things you can see**, **4 you can feel**, **3 you can hear**, **2 you can smell**, **1 you can taste**.  \nThis doesn’t fix the problem, but it helps you think clearly.\n\n## Next: do **not** message the rumor account\nMessaging or arguing can make them post more. Focus on evidence + reporting.\n\n## Step-by-step: get it taken down\n### 1) Save proof (before it disappears)\n- Take **screenshots** of the post(s), comments, username, and profile page.\n- If possible, screen-record scrolling so it shows the account + post clearly.\n- Write down: date/time, what was said, and who you think is behind it (if you know).\n\n### 2) Report the post and the account in Instagram\n**Report the post:**\n- Tap the **three dots (⋯)** on the post → **Report**.\n- Pick the closest option (often **Bullying or harassment**, **False information**, **Hate speech**, **Nudity**, **Privacy violation**, etc.).\n\n**Report the account:**\n- Go to their profile → tap **⋯** → **Report** → **Report account**.\n\n### 3) Use Instagram’s privacy/bullying reporting forms (stronger)\nIf they shared **private info** (your phone number, address, school, full name, private photos), choose options about **sharing private information**/**harassment**.  \nYou can also use Instagram’s **Help Center** to report bullying/harassment. (If you tell me what kind of rumor it is—without naming anyone—I can point you to the exact category to choose.)\n\n### 4) Ask trusted people to report it too\nInstagram often acts faster when multiple people report the same content.\nAsk a parent/guardian, friend, or teacher to help you do this.\n\n### 5) Lock down your account (so it can’t spread more)\n- Set your account to **Private**.\n- **Block** the account (and any copy accounts).\n- Turn on **Comment controls**: limit to followers / restrict keywords.\n- Use **Restrict** on anyone who is stirring it up.\n\n### 6) If it includes threats, sexual stuff, or you’re under 18\nThis is **serious** and you should get an adult involved right away.\n- If there are **threats of harm**, or you feel unsafe: tell a trusted adult **now** and consider contacting local emergency help.\n- If it includes **sexual images** of a minor (even if it’s “jokes”): tell a trusted adult immediately and report it—this can be illegal.\n\n## Who to tell (you shouldn’t handle this alone)\nPick one person right now:\n- Parent/guardian\n- School counselor, teacher, or principal\n- Another trusted adult\n\nYou can say: “Someone made a rumor account about me. I’m scared. Can you help me report it and keep me safe at school?”\n\n## Quick questions so I can guide you better\nYou can answer only what you’re comfortable with (no names):\n1) Are you **under 18**?  \n2) Did they post **your photo**, **full name**, **school**, **address/phone**, or **threats**?  \n3) Is it one post, a story, or lots of posts?\n\nIf you tell me which of those it is, I’ll give you the exact best reporting path and what buttons to press."

Can you help me tell my parents?”\n\n### 5) Remember: you still matter\nBabies need lots of care to stay safe, but that doesn’t mean you’re less important. Your parents can love the baby *and* love you just as much—even if they’re not showing it the way you need right now.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- How old are you (about)?\n- How old is the baby?\n- When do you feel most invisible—at dinner, bedtime, weekends, or all the time?  \nI can help you find the best words to say to your parents."

Puberty can just *feel* really confusing and intense, even when nothing “bad” is happening.\n\nHere’s why it can make you feel kind of gross and super emotional “for no reason”:\n\n### 1) Your hormones are changing a lot\nHormones are like chemical messengers. During puberty they can jump up and down, and that can affect:\n- your mood (more sadness, anger, irritation, anxiety)\n- your energy (tired one day, restless the next)\n- your body (sweat, oilier skin, body smell, acne)\n\nSo it can feel like your feelings are “random,” but it’s actually your body adjusting.\n\n### 2) Your brain is still upgrading\nYour brain is doing a big remodel:\n- The part that feels feelings strongly can get extra “loud.”\n- The part that helps you calm down and think things through is still growing.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you’re out of control or broken—it means your brain is learning new settings.\n\n### 3) Your body can feel unfamiliar\nGrowing, new hair, new smells, different shape, cramps (for some people), or voice changes can make you feel awkward or “gross,” even though it’s normal.\n\n### 4) Stress can hit harder\nEven small stuff (a comment, a text, a look from someone) can feel huge. That’s common in puberty.\n\n## Things that can help (simple, real-life stuff)\n- **Sleep**: Puberty makes you need more sleep than you think.\n- **Eat and drink regularly**: low blood sugar can make emotions spike.\n- **Shower/deodorant/clean clothes**: helps with the “gross” feeling and can boost mood.\n- **Move your body**: even a walk helps your brain settle.\n- **Name the feeling**: “I’m overwhelmed” or “I’m irritated” can actually make it smaller.\n- **Talk to someone safe**: a parent/guardian, school counselor, older sibling, trusted adult.\n\n## When to get extra help\nIf you’re feeling sad or upset most days for **2 weeks or more**, or you’re thinking about hurting yourself, you deserve support right away. If that happens, tell a trusted adult, or if you’re in the U.S. you can call/text **988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline). If you’re elsewhere, tell me your country and I’ll find the right number.\n\nIf you want, tell me: what part feels worst—**the emotions**, the **body changes**, or **both**?

    "safety_notes": "benign",
    "model_response": "It’s actually real, not just “math people agreed on.”\n\n### Why it happens (the big idea)\nThere’s a rule in nature: **everyone measures light moving at the same speed**, no matter how fast they’re moving. That speed is called the **speed of light**.\n\nThat sounds impossible at first, because usually speeds add up. If you run and throw a ball forward, someone watching sees the ball going faster than just the throw. But **light doesn’t work like that**: it always comes out the same speed.\n\nSo if two people are moving differently and both must still measure light at the same speed, something else has to “give.” What changes is:\n\n- **time** (clocks tick at different rates)\n- and also **distance** (lengths can shrink along the direction of motion)\n\nThis is called **relativity**, discovered by Einstein.\n\n### A kid-friendly picture: a “light clock”\nImagine a clock that ticks by bouncing a tiny flash of light between two mirrors.\n\n- If you’re sitting with the clock, the light goes straight up and down: short path, tick-tick.\n- If the clock is moving fast past you, you see the light making a zig-zag path (because the mirrors are moving while the light travels).\n\nA zig-zag is a **longer path** than straight up and down. But the light still has to move at the same fixed speed.  \nSo if the path is longer and the speed is fixed, the only way to make it work is: **it takes more time between ticks**.  \nThat means the moving clock ticks slower *from your point of view*.\n\nAnd from the moving clock’s point of view, *you* are the one moving, so your clock looks slow to them. That feels weird, but it’s how nature stays consistent.\n\n### How do we know it’s real?\nWe’ve tested it lots of times:\n\n1. **Atomic clocks on airplanes and satellites**  \n   Very precise clocks flown around the Earth end up showing tiny time differences compared to clocks that stayed on the ground—exactly what relativity predicts.\n\n2. **GPS would fail without it**  \n   GPS satellites move fast and are also higher up (gravity matters too), so their clocks tick at a different rate. GPS systems *must* correct for this, or your location would drift by kilometers.\n\n3. **Fast particles (muons) live longer**  \n   Muons made in the upper atmosphere should decay quickly and not reach the ground. But many do—because from our point of view, their “internal clock” runs slower when they’re moving near light speed.\n\n### Does it matter in everyday life?\nAt normal speeds like cars, planes, even rockets (not near light speed), the effect is **real but tiny**. You only notice it with super-precise clocks or extremely fast particles.\n\nIf you want, I can show a simple number example (like what happens at 90% the speed of light), or explain how gravity also affects time."

Most of the time, it’s not that your teacher “hates” you talking—it’s that they’re trying to keep the class running smoothly.\n\nHere are some reasons your teacher might not like it when you talk, even if you’re helping:\n\n- **It can distract other people.** Even quiet talking can make nearby students lose focus.\n- **The teacher can’t tell if it’s “helping” or “chatting.”** From the front of the room, it can all look the same.\n- **They want everyone to learn the same thing at the same time.** If your friend gets help in a different way, they might miss what the teacher is saying.\n- **Some kids might copy the talking.** If one person talks, others may start too, and the room gets loud fast.\n- **Timing matters.** Helping during instructions, tests, or quiet work time can break the rules, even with good intentions.\n\n### What you can do instead (and still be a good friend)\n- **Wait until the teacher says “work with a partner” or “you can talk quietly.”**\n- **Help using non-talking ways:** point to the directions, show where the example is, or write a quick note.\n- **Tell your friend to raise their hand** or ask the teacher for help.\n- **Ask your teacher for a “helping plan.”** Like: “Can I help my friends when I’m done, or should I stay quiet?”\n\n### A good sentence to say to your teacher\nTry this (calmly, after class or at a quiet time):\n> “I was trying to help my friend, not distract. When is it okay for me to help someone, and when should I stay quiet?”\n\nThat shows you care about doing the right thing.\n\nIf you tell me what grade you’re in and *when* you were talking (during lesson, independent work, test, etc.), I can help you figure out the best way to handle it."

    "model_response": "Setting boundaries can be kind *and* clear. The trick is to talk about **what you need** instead of what they’re “doing wrong.” Here are some ways to do it without sounding cold or accusing.\n\n## 1) Use “I” statements (not “You” statements)\nThis keeps it from sounding like blame.\n\n- Instead of: “You’re being clingy.”\n- Try: “I need a little more alone time to feel balanced.”\n\n- Instead of: “You always text too much.”\n- Try: “I feel overwhelmed when my phone keeps buzzing. I’d like us to text less during school.”\n\n## 2) Be specific about the boundary + what you want instead\nBoundaries work best when they’re clear and doable.\n\nExamples:\n- “I’m not comfortable with kissing yet. I like hanging out and holding hands.”\n- “I don’t want to share my passwords. Let’s keep our accounts private.”\n- “I need at least one night a week to myself. Can we plan our dates around that?”\n\n## 3) Add warmth without apologizing for your needs\nYou can be caring *and* firm.\n\nHelpful phrases:\n- “I really like you, and I want this to feel good for both of us.”\n- “This isn’t about you being bad—I just know what I’m comfortable with.”\n- “I’m telling you because I want us to work.”\n\n## 4) Pick a calm moment (not during an argument)\nIt’s easier when you’re both relaxed—like on a walk or after you’ve been having a good time.\n\n## 5) Try a simple “formula”\n**Care + Boundary + Reason (optional) + Alternative**\n- “I love spending time with you. I’m not ready to move that fast. I want to take it slow. Can we stick to ____ for now?”\n\n## 6) Pay attention to how they respond\nA good sign: they listen, respect it, and try.\nA not-good sign: they guilt-trip you (“If you loved me you would”), tease you, pressure you, or ignore your boundary.\n\nIf someone keeps pushing after you’ve been clear, it’s okay to repeat yourself and get firmer:\n- “I’ve said no. Please stop asking.”\n- “If this keeps happening, I’m going to leave / end the conversation.”\n\n## 7) Practice it first\nIt can help to rehearse out loud or write it down. Boundaries feel less scary when you’ve practiced.\n\nIf you tell me what kind of boundary you want to set (texts, time alone, physical stuff, privacy, friends, etc.), I can help you write a message that sounds like *you*."
