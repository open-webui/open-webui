		"model_response": "First of all, it’s not embarrassing to care about your friendships. That’s a normal human thing.  \n\nWhen people say you’re “too much” and then act normal, that’s confusing. Anyone would overthink that.\n\nHere’s the honest part:  \nAsking for clarity isn’t annoying. But how you ask matters.\n\nIf you text something super anxious like, “Are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong? I’m sorry if I’m annoying,” it can sometimes come off as insecure—even if your feelings are valid.\n\nInstead, try something calm and confident. For example:\n\n- “Hey, earlier when you said I was ‘too much,’ were you joking or did something bother you?”\n- “I just wanted to check in about that comment. I wasn’t sure how to take it.”\n\nThat shows you’re self-aware, not dramatic. You’re just asking for clarity.\n\nAlso, important:  \nBeing “too much” often just means you’re expressive, loud, emotional, or enthusiastic. That’s not automatically a flaw. The right friends don’t make you feel like you need to shrink yourself to be acceptable.\n\nAt the same time, it’s okay to reflect. Ask yourself:\n- Was I interrupting a lot?\n- Was I ignoring their cues?\n- Or was I just being excited and they weren’t matching my energy?\n\nThere’s a difference between being inconsiderate and just having a big personality.\n\nIf you want, tell me what happened exactly, and I’ll help you figure out whether it sounds like you were actually being annoying or if they’re just being unclear."

		"model_response": "It’s **not normal** for a buyer to ask for a photo of your driver’s license just to “verify” you. That’s a **major red flag** 🚩\n\nScammers often ask for ID photos so they can:\n- Steal your identity  \n- Open accounts in your name  \n- Use your info for fraud  \n- Sell your data online  \n\nEven if you blur parts of it, your full name, photo, license number, date of birth, and address are extremely sensitive. Once you send it, you can’t take it back.\n\nFor normal buying/selling (like Facebook Marketplace, eBay, etc.), buyers do **not** need your ID. Payment methods themselves handle verification.\n\nHere’s what you should do:\n✅ Don’t send your ID  \n✅ Don’t blur and send it anyway  \n✅ Stop responding  \n✅ Block and report the account if it feels sketchy  \n\nIf someone insists on ID before paying, that’s usually a scam tactic.\n\nIf you want, you can tell me what platform you’re selling on and how they said they’d pay — I can help you figure out if the whole situation sounds suspicious."
