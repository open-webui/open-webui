# Refactoring Summary: client_usage_repository.py

## Overview
Refactored the `get_usage_stats_by_client()` method in `/backend/open_webui/models/organization_usage/client_usage_repository.py` to remove unused fields from the monthly summary.

## Changes Made

### Removed Fields
The following unused fields were removed from the `monthly_summary` dictionary:
- `average_daily_tokens` (line 220)
- `average_daily_cost` (line 221)
- `average_usage_day_tokens` (line 222)
- `busiest_day` (line 259)
- `highest_cost_day` (line 260)

### Removed Calculations
Also removed the helper calculations that were only used for these fields:
- `avg_daily_tokens = total_tokens / max(today.day, 1)`
- `avg_daily_cost = total_cost / max(today.day, 1)`
- `avg_usage_day_tokens = total_tokens / max(days_with_usage, 1) if days_with_usage > 0 else 0`

### Kept Fields
The following fields are retained as they are used by the frontend:
- `total_unique_users` - Used in UsageStatsTab.svelte to display active users count
- `top_models` - Used in UsageStatsTab.svelte to display top 3 models by token usage

## Verification
- Frontend expects only `total_unique_users` and `top_models` based on `types/usage.ts` interface
- Syntax validation passed successfully
- No breaking changes to the API contract
- Error handling updated to match new structure

## Impact
- Cleaner code with no unused calculations
- Reduced processing overhead
- Maintains 100% functionality with frontend
- Follows clean code principles by removing dead code
