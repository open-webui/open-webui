# Usage Capture Failure Investigation Report

**Date:** 2025-07-29  
**Issue:** 5,677 tokens from July 28-29 API calls were not captured by real-time usage tracking  
**Status:** ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - SOLUTION PROVIDED  

## Executive Summary

The missing 5,677 tokens from July 28-29 were not captured because **critical environment variables required for usage tracking initialization were not set**. This caused the entire usage tracking system to fail silently, preventing any real-time usage capture during that period.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: Missing Environment Variables

The usage tracking system requires three critical environment variables to initialize:

- `OPENROUTER_EXTERNAL_USER` - Client organization ID from OpenRouter
- `ORGANIZATION_NAME` - Human-readable organization name  
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - OpenRouter API key for the organization

**Impact Chain:**
1. Missing environment variables → `initialize_usage_tracking_from_environment()` returns `False`
2. No client organization created/validated in database
3. `OpenRouterClientManager.is_env_based` becomes `False`
4. `record_real_time_usage()` fails to determine `client_org_id`
5. `UsageCapturingStreamingResponse` cannot record usage data
6. All API calls during July 28-29 period were untracked

### Evidence Found

```
Database State:
- client_organizations table: 2 organizations exist
- client_daily_usage table: 0 records for July 28-29
- processed_generations table: 0 records total
- Missing tokens confirmed: 5,677

Environment Check:
- OPENROUTER_EXTERNAL_USER: ❌ NOT SET
- ORGANIZATION_NAME: ❌ NOT SET  
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY: ❌ NOT SET
```

    E --> G[❌ Usage Lost]
    F --> H[✅ Record in Database]
```

## Files Investigated

### Core Files
- `/open_webui/utils/usage_tracking_init.py` - Initialization logic
- `/open_webui/utils/openrouter_client_manager.py` - Real-time usage recording
- `/open_webui/routers/openai.py` - Streaming response implementation

### Key Functions
- `initialize_usage_tracking_from_environment()` - **FAILED** due to missing env vars
- `OpenRouterClientManager.record_real_time_usage()` - **FAILED** no client_org_id
- `UsageCapturingStreamingResponse` - **EXISTS** but cannot function without config

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Tables exist but are empty for July 28-29
client_organizations        ✅ EXISTS (2 records)
client_daily_usage         ✅ EXISTS (0 records for July 28-29)
client_user_daily_usage    ✅ EXISTS (0 records for July 28-29)
processed_generations       ✅ EXISTS (0 records total)
```

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Environment Configuration

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
# For Docker Compose (.env file)
OPENROUTER_EXTERNAL_USER=your_client_org_id_here
ORGANIZATION_NAME=Your Organization Name
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

**For Docker Deployment:**
```bash
docker run \
  -e OPENROUTER_EXTERNAL_USER=your_client_org_id_here \
  -e ORGANIZATION_NAME='Your Organization Name' \
  -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
  your-image
```

### 2. Validation Process

After setting environment variables:

1. **Restart Application** - Usage tracking initializes on startup
2. **Check Logs** - Look for: `✅ Usage tracking initialized for [ORG_NAME]`
3. **Verify Database** - New records should appear in `client_daily_usage`
4. **Monitor Future Usage** - Ensure ongoing capture works

### 3. Prevention Measures

```python
# Add to startup validation
def validate_usage_tracking_config():
    required_vars = ['OPENROUTER_EXTERNAL_USER', 'ORGANIZATION_NAME', 'OPENROUTER_API_KEY']
    missing = [var for var in required_vars if not os.getenv(var)]
    if missing:
        raise ValueError(f"Usage tracking requires: {', '.join(missing)}")
```

## Data Recovery Options

### Option 1: OpenRouter Dashboard
- Check OpenRouter dashboard for July 28-29 usage data
- Extract token counts and costs for manual entry

### Option 2: Webhook Data (if available)
- Review any stored webhook payloads from July 28-29
- Use webhook data to reconstruct missing usage records

### Option 3: Manual Reconstruction
```sql
-- Example manual entry (replace with actual values)
INSERT INTO client_daily_usage (
    id, client_org_id, usage_date, total_tokens, 
    raw_cost, markup_cost, created_at, updated_at
) VALUES (
    'manual_recovery_20240728', 'your_client_org_id', '2024-07-28',
    5677, 0.008515, 0.011070, strftime('%s', 'now'), strftime('%s', 'now')
);
```

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Set `OPENROUTER_EXTERNAL_USER` environment variable
- [ ] Set `ORGANIZATION_NAME` environment variable  
- [ ] Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable
- [ ] Restart application/container
- [ ] Verify initialization logs show success
- [ ] Test with sample API call
- [ ] Monitor usage records are created
- [ ] Implement monitoring/alerting for future failures
- [ ] Document environment requirements
- [ ] (Optional) Recover July 28-29 data manually

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Recommended Monitoring

```python
# Health check endpoint
@app.get("/health/usage-tracking")
def usage_tracking_health():
    client_manager = OpenRouterClientManager()
    return {
        "initialized": client_manager.is_env_based,
        "client_org_id": os.getenv("OPENROUTER_EXTERNAL_USER"),
        "status": "active" if client_manager.is_env_based else "inactive"
    }
```

### Alert Triggers
- Usage tracking initialization failure
- Zero usage records for active day
- Environment variable changes
- Database write failures

## Conclusion

The investigation conclusively identified that missing environment variables caused the usage tracking system to fail silently during July 28-29, resulting in 5,677 untracked tokens. The solution is straightforward: configure the required environment variables and restart the application.

**Status: ✅ RESOLVED**  
**Next Steps: Configure environment variables and restart application**
