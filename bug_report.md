# Bug Investigation Report - pon 28 lip 22:26:58 2025 CEST
## Issue Description
- Symptom: Model Pricing tab shows 'No pricing data available' instead of expected 12 models
- Expected: Display 12 models with pricing data from OpenRouter API or fallback data
- Environment: mAI (OpenWebUI fork) with usage tracking system
## Phase 1 Frontend Analysis Findings

### Component Structure Analysis
- ModelPricingTab.svelte: Receives modelPricingData as prop, displays count and data
- DataTable.svelte: Shows emptyMessage when data.length === 0
- Container: Lazy loads pricing data when tab clicked and modelPricingData.length === 0

### Data Flow Analysis
1. pricingStore initialized with empty modelPricingData: []
2. User clicks 'Model Pricing' tab
3. handleTabChange() calls loadModelPricing() if array is empty
4. PricingService.getModelPricing() should return 12 fallback models
5. pricingActions.setPricingData() should update store
6. Component should receive data via props

### Fallback Data Analysis
- PricingService contains 12 hardcoded models in FALLBACK_PRICING
- Logic should use fallback if API fails or returns empty array
- Even complete API failure should still show 12 models

### Root Cause Investigation Strategy

**Systematic Debugging Added:**
1. Added comprehensive console logging to PricingService.getModelPricing()
2. Added debugging to Container.loadModelPricing() function
3. Added debugging to pricingActions.setPricingData() store action
4. Added debugging to ModelPricingTab component props
5. Added debugging to API endpoint getMAIModelPricing()
6. Added debugging to handleTabChange() pricing tab logic

**Next Steps for User:**
1. Navigate to the Model Pricing tab in the application
2. Open browser Developer Tools (F12) and check Console tab
3. Look for [DEBUG] messages to trace the data flow
4. Report back the console output to identify where the process breaks

**Expected Debug Output:**
- Should see Container starting load, API call, PricingService processing
- Should show fallback data with count of 12 models
- Should show store update and component receiving data

**Most Likely Issues:**
- API endpoint not responding correctly
- Store action not updating state properly
- Component not receiving updated props from store
- Data structure mismatch between API and component expectations
