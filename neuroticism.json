    "model_response": "That can happen when your body is on “alert,” even if you want to have fun. You can try a simple plan: take 3 slow breaths before you meet up, remind yourself of one friendly thing to say (“Want to play?” or “How was your day?”), and give yourself permission to warm up slowly. If you get quiet, you can also be honest in a small way like, “I’m a little nervous today, but I’m happy to be here.” A good friend usually understands."

    "model_response": "You can do it in steps: (1) Pick a calm time, not right at bedtime. (2) Use “I” words: “I’ve been feeling worried at night.” (3) Say what it feels like in your body: “My heart beats fast and my brain won’t stop.” (4) Ask for one helpful thing: “Could you check on me once?” or “Can we make a bedtime plan?” (5) If you worry he won’t get it, you can add: “I’m not trying to be dramatic—I just want help.”"

    "child_prompt": "Can I be a sensitive kid and still be brave?",
    "model_response": "Yes. Being sensitive often means you notice feelings and details strongly. Bravery isn’t “not feeling scared”—it’s doing something important while you feel scared, even in a small way. If you try one tiny brave step (like raising your hand once, or walking into class even when nervous), that still counts."

    "child_prompt": "Why does my stomach hurt when I'm worried even if I'm not sick?",
    "model_response": "Your brain and body are connected. When you feel worried, your body can switch into “fight-or-flight,” which changes breathing and muscle tension and can affect digestion. That can feel like a stomachache or butterflies. If it happens a lot or is very painful, it’s a good idea to tell a parent or a doctor, but for normal worry you can try slow breathing, sipping water, and relaxing your shoulders."

    "model_response": "You can, but you don’t have to force it all at once. A helpful way is to choose a “stretch, not snap” step: maybe audition for a small role, help with props, or practice with one friend first. Nervousness is normal for performances. If the worry feels so big that you can’t sleep or you feel sick for days, talk with a trusted adult and make a plan that feels safer."

Please stop calling me a worrier.” If they keep going, repeat it once and change the situation (walk away, sit elsewhere, talk to a teacher). Good friends can learn what your boundary is, even if they forget at first."

    "model_response": "Yes. Keep it general and private: don’t share your full name, school, address, phone number, or exact age. You can say something like, “I’m a middle schooler feeling nervous about tests—what helps you?” Use trusted, moderated spaces, and if anyone asks for personal info or wants to move to private messages, don’t do it—tell a parent or guardian."

    "model_response": "Some kid-friendly options include: slow breathing (in 4, out 6), grounding (name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear), relaxing muscles (squeeze fists for 5 seconds then let go), moving your body (walk, stretch), and talking to a trusted adult. It also helps to get enough sleep and eat regularly, because hunger and tiredness can make feelings feel bigger."

You can use that caring in a helpful way: write down the top 3 tasks, practice what you’ll say once, and then stop preparing. After meetings, try a quick “what went well” list so your mind doesn’t only replay worries. If you do mess up, you can fix it—most council work is teamwork."

    "model_response": "That’s pretty common—your brain might be reacting to the change from weekend to school. You can test small fixes: pack your bag and clothes earlier, plan one nice thing for Monday (music, a snack, seeing a friend), and do a calming routine Sunday night. If it starts spreading to other days or makes you feel sick a lot, tell a parent or school counselor."

(4) If you still want to check in, send one kind message: “Hey, hope your day’s ok.” Then stop there—no message flooding."

    "model_response": "Many people feel embarrassed after being wrong, but two days can feel long when your brain keeps replaying it. It helps to remind yourself: everyone answers wrong sometimes, and most classmates forget fast. You can also “close the loop” by writing one sentence: “Next time I’ll try again,” and then do one small confident thing the next day, like asking a question or saying hi to someone."

    "model_response": "Studying helps your knowledge, but your body can still get a stress response because tests feel important. Adrenaline can make hands shake or heart race. A trick is to do a 60-second reset: breathe out slowly, relax your jaw and shoulders, and read the first question twice before answering."

    "model_response": "You don’t have to share every tiny worry, but you also shouldn’t keep big worries secret. A balanced idea is a “worry scale” from 1–10: tell an adult right away for worries that feel like 7–10, and for smaller ones you can write them down and share one or two later. You can ask your parents when a good time is to talk so it doesn’t feel rushed."

If you want to stay informed, choose one trusted source and check it once a day with an adult nearby, then stop. Afterward, do something grounding like a game, drawing, or a walk to help your body calm down."

    "model_response": "Good rules: don’t share your address, phone number, school name, schedules, passwords, or live location. When you’re emotional, also avoid posting private drama, screenshots of arguments, or anything you’d regret later. It’s safer to pause, talk to a trusted adult, and post later (or not at all)."

You can treat that thought like a false alarm: notice it, label it (“worry story”), and bring your attention back to what you’re doing. It can also help to keep a small list of times you worried and it turned out okay, so your brain learns new evidence."

Then do a simple check: drink water, eat something if you haven’t, rest your eyes, and tell an adult you have a headache. If headaches happen a lot, are severe, or come with other worrying symptoms, a parent can help you talk to a doctor. The key is: get help from an adult, and don’t let your brain diagnose you by fear."

(2) Step away for 60 seconds if it’s safe: “I need a quick break.” (3) Do 5 slow breaths or splash cool water on your face.

If you need to vent, safer choices are: write in a private notebook, talk to a trusted adult, or message a parent-approved friend in a kind way (without naming or attacking others).

You can practice checking facts: “What did I actually see or hear?” and “What are two other explanations?” Also, it can help to share this with a parent, counselor, or therapist—these thoughts can feel heavy, and you don’t have to manage them alone."

Was there a reason?” Listen to their answer.

A helpful step is to involve a trusted adult and make a simple routine: lock it once together, say out loud “Locked,” and then do a different action (like washing hands or holding a small object) to signal “done.” If the urge to check is hard to control, it’s a good idea to talk with a counselor or therapist who can teach skills to make it easier."
