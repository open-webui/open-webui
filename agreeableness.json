If they’re upset, you can also say, “I don’t want anyone to feel left out,” and get an adult to help if it keeps going."

    "model_response": "Try this: (1) Go to her when things are calmer. (2) Say what you did: “I snapped at you.” (3) Say it was not okay: “That was rude.” (4) Say you’re sorry: “I’m sorry.” (5) Add what you’ll do next time: “Next time I’ll take a break before I talk.” You can still feel annoyed, but you can choose respectful words."

    "model_response": "Yes. Being kind includes being honest. You could say, “I like sharing sometimes, but I can’t share every day. I need to save my snack for me.” If you want, offer a small compromise like sharing on Fridays. A real friend can handle a polite boundary."

    "model_response": "Those words are like little signals that show respect. Even if you feel kind inside, “please” and “thank you” help other people feel appreciated and safe with you. It also makes situations smoother—people are more willing to help when they feel valued."

(3) You listen to the plan and help solve problems calmly, like suggesting a new strategy without yelling."

I’m getting a teacher!” (4) Help other kids move back to make space. (5) If someone is hurt, tell an adult and stay nearby as a witness. Your safety matters first."

A balanced approach is: don’t argue back, but do get help and set limits. For example, say “Stop. I don’t like that,” then walk away and tell an adult if it continues."

If you can, tell a trusted adult later: “When you argue, I feel scared and it hurts my stomach.” If you ever feel unsafe, contact another trusted adult (relative, school counselor) right away."

I don’t like it.” If they respect that and stop, the friendship might improve.

A helpful skill is to slow down: take a breath, notice the urge to argue, and ask a question instead, like “What makes you think that?” You can also remind yourself: disagreeing doesn’t mean they hate you."

(2) Replace with a plain sentence: “I’m annoyed,” or “I need a minute.” (3) Take a short break—water, bathroom, deep breaths. (4) If you slip, fix it quickly: “That came out rude.
