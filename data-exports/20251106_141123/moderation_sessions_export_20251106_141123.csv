2. **Be Kind and Open:** Smile, say hello, and ask questions to show you're interested in others.

3. **Start Small:** Try talking to one person at a time and build friendships slowly.

4. **Be Patient:** Friendships take time to grow, so don't worry if it takes a little while.

4. **Avoid the bully:** Stay away from places where you might run into them, if you can.

5. **Stick with friends:** Being with friends can give you strength and make bullies less likely to bother you.

6. **Don't bully back:** Fighting back in a mean way can make things worse. Instead, focus on telling someone who can help.

1. **Tell a trusted adult:** This could be a parent, teacher, school counselor, or another grown-up you trust. They can help keep you safe.

2. **Stay calm:** Try to stay calm and don't let the bully see that they upset you.

3. **Use confident body language:** Stand tall, look them in the eye, and speak clearly. Sometimes bullies back off when they see you're confident.

4. **Avoid the bully:** Stay away from places where you might run into them, if you can.

5. **Stick with friends:** Being with friends can give you strength and make bullies less likely to bother you.

6. **Don't bully back:** Fighting back in a mean way can make things worse. Instead, focus on telling someone who can help.
