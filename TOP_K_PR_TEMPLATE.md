# Fix: Too Many Results When Using Multiple Knowledge Bases

## 🐛 **Issue Description**
Fixes issue #17706: When using multiple knowledge bases with a model, the system returns Top-K results **per knowledge base** instead of Top-K results **total**.

- **Problem**: Top-K = 1 with 2 knowledge bases returns 2 results instead of 1
- **Root Cause**: Each knowledge base queried with K limit individually, then results merged
- **Impact**: Users get more results than requested, breaking Top-K semantics
- **User Experience**: Confusing behavior when configuring multiple knowledge bases

**Related Issue**: #17706

## 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Per-Collection Limiting**: `query_collection()` queries each KB with Top-K limit
2. **Late Merging**: Results combined after individual K limits applied  
3. **Incorrect Semantics**: Final result = K × Number of Knowledge Bases
4. **Missing Global Limit**: No mechanism to apply Top-K across all collections

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. Expanded Query Limits
- **File**: `backend/open_webui/retrieval/utils.py`
- Modified `query_collection()` to use expanded K limit for initial queries
- Modified `query_collection_with_hybrid_search()` for hybrid search scenarios
- Calculate `expanded_k = min(k * num_collections, k * 10)` to get sufficient candidates

### 2. Smart Expansion Logic
- **Single Collection**: No expansion (preserves existing behavior)
- **Multiple Collections**: Expand by collection count with 10x cap
- **Performance Protection**: Cap prevents excessive resource usage
- **Correct Semantics**: Final Top-K applied across all results

### 3. Hybrid Search Support
- Expand both `k` and `k_reranker` parameters
- Maintain proper reranking behavior across collections
- Ensure consistent results between regular and hybrid search

## 📊 **Performance Impact**

| Scenario | Collections | K | Expanded K | Query Overhead | Status |
|----------|-------------|---|------------|----------------|---------|
| Single KB | 1 | 5 | 5 | 0% | No change |
| Typical | 2 | 1 | 2 | +100% | Acceptable |
| Medium | 3 | 5 | 15 | +200% | Acceptable |
| Large | 5 | 10 | 50 | +400% | Acceptable |
| Capped | 10 | 20 | 200 | +900% | Capped at 10x |

**Performance Notes**:
- Overhead acceptable for correct functionality
- Most real-world scenarios have 2-3 knowledge bases
- 10x cap prevents excessive resource usage
- Correctness prioritized over minor performance impact

## 🧪 **Testing**

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **File**: `test_top_k_fix.py`
- All test scenarios covered:
  - ✅ Issue #17706 exact reproduction
  - ✅ Single collection behavior unchanged
  - ✅ Multiple collections proper Top-K limiting
  - ✅ Duplicate document handling with best scores
  - ✅ Performance limits and 10x cap validation
  - ✅ Hybrid search K and K_reranker expansion

### Validation Results
```bash
# Issue reproduction test
Setup: Top-K=1, Collections=2, Expected=1
BEFORE: 2 results (WRONG)
AFTER: 1 result (CORRECT) ✅

# Performance analysis
Typical case: +100% overhead (acceptable)
Large case: +400% overhead (acceptable)
Capped case: Limited to 10x maximum ✅
```

## 🔄 **Backward Compatibility**
- ✅ **No breaking changes** to existing APIs
- ✅ **Single knowledge base**: Behavior completely unchanged
- ✅ **Multiple knowledge bases**: Now works correctly as expected
- ✅ **Performance**: Acceptable overhead with protective caps

## 📁 **Files Changed**
- `backend/open_webui/retrieval/utils.py` - Fixed both query functions
- `fix_top_k_multiple_knowledge_bases.py` - Implementation guide and examples
- `test_top_k_fix.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `FIX_TOP_K_MULTIPLE_KNOWLEDGE_BASES.md` - Detailed technical documentation

## 🚀 **Deployment Notes**
1. Apply code changes to `retrieval/utils.py`
2. Restart OpenWebUI service
3. Test with multiple knowledge bases:
   - Set Top-K to 1 in Documents Settings
   - Create 2+ knowledge bases with documents
   - Configure model to use both knowledge bases
   - Verify only 1 result returned total (not 2+)
4. Monitor performance with large knowledge base setups

## 📈 **Monitoring Recommendations**
- Monitor query response times with multiple knowledge bases
- Check memory usage during expanded queries
- Verify result counts match Top-K settings exactly
- Test with various K values and collection combinations

## 🎯 **User Impact**
- **Before**: Confusing behavior - Top-K=1 returns multiple results
- **After**: Intuitive behavior - Top-K=1 returns exactly 1 result
- **Benefit**: Knowledge bases work as users expect
- **Experience**: Seamless multi-KB configuration
