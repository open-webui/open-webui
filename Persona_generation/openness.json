A useful challenge is to ask, “What are they worried about?” and “What do they value?” You can disagree without being mean. If a conversation turns into insults, it’s okay to pause and talk to a trusted adult or teacher about how to handle it respectfully."

It’s okay to feel confident in your beliefs, but it’s important to speak respectfully about others.
