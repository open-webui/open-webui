    "model_response": "Try breaking it into small jobs and putting them on a simple calendar. Day 1–2: pick the book and read the rules. Days 3–8: read a set number of pages each day. Day 9: write a short outline (beginning, middle, end, theme). Days 10–12: write one paragraph at a time. Day 13: revise and check spelling. Day 14: final copy and make sure you have everything (title page, citations if needed). If you miss a day, don’t quit—just do the next small step."

    "model_response": "You can show them your work and ask calmly: “I finished my chores. Can you check them? If they look good, can I have extra free time?” You could also suggest a plan like, “I’ll do my chores by 5:00 on weekdays, and then I can play.” Being consistent for a few days is what usually builds trust."

    "model_response": "Yes, it can be okay if you do it respectfully. You could raise your hand and say, “Just checking—was the homework due today?” That’s a helpful reminder, not being annoying. If your teacher says it’s different, just accept it and move on."

    "model_response": "A lot of math mistakes are “careless errors,” not “I don’t get it” errors—like copying a number wrong, missing a minus sign, or skipping a step. A good habit is to slow down for the last minute: re-check each step, circle negatives, and estimate what the answer should be. That way you catch small slips."

    "model_response": "A checklist can be helpful if you make it feel like teamwork. You can say, “I made a list so we don’t miss anything—want to add to it?” Ask what task they want to take. Being organized isn’t bossy when you’re also being fair and listening."

Tell yourself, “I can watch after I finish 20 minutes of homework.” Starting with a small work chunk makes it less tempting to keep scrolling."

Each week, write down (1) starting amount, (2) any income (dues, fundraiser), (3) any expenses (supplies, snacks), (4) ending amount, and (5) who approved the spending. Keep receipts or a photo of them if your advisor allows it. That way you’re accurate and transparent."

Keeping the same order every day saves time because you don’t have to think as much."

You can remind them once, but it’s okay to ask for teamwork: “Can you set the reminder this time?” If they still forget often, you can make plans that don’t depend on them as much, or choose friends who meet you halfway.

    "model_response": "Deadlines help teachers plan lessons and grading, and they also teach a life skill—other people rely on timing (like practices, projects, and jobs). Turning things in on time shows reliability. If you have a real problem, it’s usually better to tell the teacher early rather than after the deadline."

    "model_response": "Some people can, but many can’t because switching attention makes work slower and more error-prone. You could test it: try 15 minutes with your phone away and see how much you finish, then compare to 15 minutes with texting. If you focus better without it, save texting for a break."

    "model_response": "A fair way is to list all tasks, estimate how long each takes, and let people choose while keeping it balanced. You can also pair up jobs so no one is alone doing a big task. If someone doesn’t do their part, involve the teacher or advisor rather than arguing—adults can help make responsibilities clearer."

Can we plan which days are high effort and which days are lighter?” If you can, suggest a solution like practicing 4 days plus 1 lighter skill day.

I can do X tonight and send it by 8:00, and I can also do an extra part to make up for it.” People usually trust you more when you tell the truth and follow through with a clear plan."

A helpful trick is to notice your “warning signs” (laughing, looking at friends, tapping) and do a replacement action—like doodling quietly, squeezing a stress ball if allowed, or taking one slow breath and focusing on writing one sentence. If it’s happening a lot, talking with a teacher or counselor can help you find the real cause."

A better way is to use websites to understand the idea, then close them and write in your own words from what you learned.

Set a phone alarm (with parent permission) or put a note where you can’t miss it, like on the fridge. You can also make a simple chart and check it off so you can see if it’s done."
