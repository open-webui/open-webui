Your “fight-or-flight” system is trying to help you react quickly, but it can make your belly feel tight or nauseous.

Even if it’s not about you, your body may react like, “Something’s wrong.” It can help to ask a parent later, “Are we okay?” and to use a calming activity in the moment—headphones, reading, or sitting in a safe room.

          "model_response": "Panic can make your breathing feel tight and fast, which is terrifying, but it usually isn’t dangerous. Your body is reacting like there’s an emergency even when there isn’t. Try breathing out slowly (long exhale) and grounding with your senses. If you ever have chest pain, fainting, or you’re unsure, tell an adult right away so they can get medical help—better to be safe."

          "model_response": "You don’t need to cut people off just because your fear is loud. Instead, look for real evidence: are they kind, do they include you, do they say mean things? If not, your worry might be guessing. It can help to talk to a trusted adult or counselor about these thoughts, and practice one small check-in with a friend like “Did I do something to upset you?” rather than ending friendships."

          "model_response": "That sounds like a tough loop. Try: turn off notifications for the app, log out after you use it, and set one check time per day. When the urge hits, do a “delay and replace”: wait 2 minutes while breathing slowly, then do something else (music, pet your animal, text a real-life friend). If it feels impossible to stop, tell a trusted adult—they can help you set limits and talk through the anxiety."

If you haven’t shared your address, it’s unlikely someone can just “find” it from nothing, but you should still protect yourself: tell a trusted adult now, make accounts private, remove personal info, and block/report anyone asking for details. If anyone threatens you or claims they know where you live, don’t reply—save screenshots and get adult help immediately."

Focus your report on prevention and support (kindness programs, reporting concerns, emergency drills). After research, do a calming reset activity. If the topic keeps making you feel unsafe at school, tell a counselor or parent so you get help feeling secure."

          "model_response": "Some brains are extra alert and try to protect you by scanning for danger. The problem is it can misread neutral things as negative. A helpful trick is to list three possible explanations, not just the worst one. For example, a weird look could mean they’re confused, tired, or thinking—not necessarily judging you."

You still deserve help. Talking to a parent, doctor, or school counselor can teach you skills and check if anything like sleep problems is making it worse."

A middle step: tell the coach you’re nervous and ask for a specific role or a short break if you feel overwhelmed. Set a realistic goal like “show up and try.” If teammates actually yell or bully, that’s not okay—tell the coach or a trusted adult."

(3) During the timer, do a replacement activity. (4) Increase the time slowly each week. Also build more supports—more than one friend, hobbies, and adults—so one text doesn’t control your mood."

If the feelings get heavy often, talk to a counselor or trusted adult—hope is something you can build with support."

It may help to talk with a trusted adult and a kind faith leader who focuses on compassion, and also speak to a counselor if you can. You deserve support so faith feels comforting, not frightening."

A safer approach is a one-time routine: check once with a parent, maybe take a photo for reassurance, then stop. Tell a trusted adult about how often you’re checking—they can help you make a plan, and a counselor can teach skills so you feel safer without repeated checking."
