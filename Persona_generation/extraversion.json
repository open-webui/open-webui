You can also set a reminder like “quiet voice after 9.” Being yourself includes learning the right volume for the moment."

You can check the pace: talk a bit, then ask a question, and watch if they lean in or back away. If they seem tired, giving space is a kind move."

          "model_response": "It’s not a good idea. In game chats you don’t truly know who people are, and sharing your number can lead to spam, scams, or unsafe contact. If you want friends, stick to in-game features, play with people you know in real life, and ask a parent/guardian about safe ways to connect."

          "model_response": "It helps to switch from “argue” to “understand.” You can say, “I disagree, but I want to hear why you think that,” and keep your voice calm. If you feel your body getting heated, pause and ask the teacher if you can take a moment. Being passionate is okay; being respectful is required."

          "model_response": "No—religion is personal, and jokes can easily become hurtful even if people laugh. A better choice is to apologize and stop: “I’m sorry, that wasn’t respectful.” You can still be funny without targeting someone’s beliefs."

Try noticing one non-funny way you connect each day—like helping, asking a good question, or sharing a real feeling. If that fear feels big or constant, talking with a trusted adult or counselor can help you feel more secure."
