(4) Introduce yourself to one person: “Hi, I’m __. Is this your first time too?” (5) Volunteer for a small task, like passing out papers.

A good rule is “answer, then pause.” After you answer once, try waiting and counting to five before raising your hand again.

    "model_response": "Some people get energy from being around others—your brain might feel more “awake” with conversation, teamwork, and laughter. It doesn’t mean you never need quiet time; it just means social time is one way you recharge. Paying attention to when you feel energized versus tired can help you balance both."

Could we pick one day this month for a hangout?” Offer options (after homework, weekend afternoon) and ask what rules they want (snacks, time, cleanup).

If someone is quiet, you can ask one gentle question like “How was your day?” and then let them choose to answer or not. Also, if drama starts, it’s okay to pause the chat or ask an adult for help."

If someone suggests something unsafe or secret, you can say, “No thanks,” and go back to the main group. Being outgoing is awesome, and being smart keeps it fun."

(3) Write 2–3 words of your idea so you don’t forget. (4) Wait for a natural gap, then raise your hand. (5) If you slip, say “Sorry—go ahead” and let the other person continue.
