# Implementation Plan

Check existing dependencies and get Open WebUI running locally for testing.

This involves verifying that both frontend (SvelteKit) and backend (FastAPI) dependencies are installed correctly and the applications can start without import or build errors. The main issue encountered is a compatibility issue with the pydub library on Python 3.13 where the required audioop module has been removed from the standard library.

## Overview

The Open WebUI project consists of a full-stack AI platform with:
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) providing REST API endpoints for AI chat, document processing, and user management
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit (TypeScript/JavaScript) providing the web interface
- **Integration**: Supports Ollama, OpenAI APIs, RAG functionality, and various AI models

The current blocking issue is Python 3.13 compatibility with the pydub library, which requires the 'audioop' module that was removed from Python's standard library in 3.13. All dependencies appear to be otherwise correctly specified.

## Types

No type system changes required.

No new types or interfaces are needed for dependency verification. The type system is already well-established with both Python (via FastAPI/Pydantic) and TypeScript (via SvelteKit).

## Files

No new files required for dependency verification.

Existing files to be examined:
- `/backend/requirements-fixed.txt` - Backend Python dependencies (70+ packages including FastAPI, uvicorn, pydantic, OpenAI, chromadb, etc.)
- `/package.json` - Frontend Node.js dependencies (85+ packages including SvelteKit, Vite, Yjs, etc.)
- `/backend/venv/` - Python virtual environment directory with installed packages

Configuration file updates:
- Python version constraint may need adjustment from 3.13 to 3.12 or 3.11 for audioop compatibility

## Functions

No function modifications required.

Existing functions for startup and dependency management are working correctly. The issue is with third-party library compatibility, not application code.

## Classes

No class modifications required.

The class structure for both frontend and backend is well-implemented and doesn't need changes for dependency verification.

## Dependencies

Minimal dependency modifications needed.

New package requirements:
- None required

Version changes needed:
- pydub version should be reviewed for Python 3.13 compatibility (currently unspecified version)
- Consider adding "pyaudioop" as a fallback package for Python 3.13

Other packages unaffected:
- All other 70+ backend dependencies and 85+ frontend dependencies are compatible

## Testing

Automated dependency test required.

Test approach:
- Unit tests for import verification of both backend and frontend
- Integration tests for startup scripts (dev.sh, build commands)
- Environment-specific tests (Python 3.13 compatibility checks)

Test files:
- Expand existing backend unit tests to include import smoke tests
- Add frontend build verification tests

## Implementation Order

1. Diagnose and fix Python 3.13 audioop/pyaudioop compatibility issue with pydub
2. Verify all backend dependencies import correctly
3. Verify frontend npm dependencies install and build successfully
4. Test backend dev.sh startup script
5. Test frontend npm run dev command
6. Confirm applications run on expected ports (8080 for backend, 5173 for frontend)
7. Document complete setup instructions with working dependencies
