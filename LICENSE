5. The branding restriction enumerated in Clause 4 shall not apply in the following limited circumstances: (i) deployments or distributions where the total number of end users (defined as individual natural persons with direct access to the application) does not exceed fifty (50) within any rolling thirty (30) day period; (ii) cases in which the licensee is an official contributor to the codebase—with a substantive code change successfully merged into the main branch of the official codebase maintained by the copyright holder—who has obtained specific prior written permission for branding adjustment from the copyright holder; or (iii) where the licensee has obtained a duly executed enterprise license expressly permitting such modification. For all other cases, any removal or alteration of the "Open WebUI" branding shall constitute a material breach of license.
