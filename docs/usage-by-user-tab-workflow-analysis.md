## Detailed Workflow: Data Collection to Display

### Phase 1: Enhanced Usage Data Collection (Real-time 2025-01-27)
**Primary Trigger**: Real-time streaming capture via `UsageCapturingStreamingResponse`
**Secondary Trigger**: Legacy OpenRouter webhook (still supported)
**Entry Point**: `ClientUsageRepository.record_usage()`

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Usage Recording with Deduplication
```python
# Backend: client_usage_repository.py (Enhanced 2025-01-27)
def record_usage(self, usage_record: UsageRecordDTO) -> bool:
    """Record API usage with per-user tracking - Enhanced with real-time capture"""
    
    # CRITICAL: Enhanced with generation_id deduplication (2025-01-27)
    if usage_record.generation_id and ProcessedGenerationDB.is_generation_processed(
        usage_record.generation_id, usage_record.client_org_id
    ):
        log.info(f"Generation {usage_record.generation_id} already processed, skipping duplicate")
        return True
    
    # 1. Create unique daily record ID
    user_usage_id = f"{client_org_id}:{user_id}:{usage_date}"
    
    # 2. Query existing record or create new
    user_usage = db.query(ClientUserDailyUsage).filter_by(id=user_usage_id).first()
    
    # 3. Aggregate usage metrics with enhanced accuracy
    if user_usage:
        user_usage.total_tokens += usage_record.total_tokens  # tokens_prompt + tokens_completion
        user_usage.total_requests += 1
        user_usage.raw_cost += usage_record.raw_cost  # from 'usage' field
        user_usage.markup_cost += usage_record.markup_cost
    else:
        # Create new daily usage record with corrected field mapping
        user_usage = ClientUserDailyUsage(
            id=user_usage_id,
            total_tokens=usage_record.total_tokens,  # Enhanced accuracy
            raw_cost=usage_record.raw_cost,  # Correct OpenRouter field mapping
            markup_cost=usage_record.markup_cost,
            ...
        )
```

**Enhanced Business Rules Applied (2025-01-27):**
- **Real-Time Recording**: Immediate user activity capture from streaming and non-streaming responses
- **Generation ID Deduplication**: Bulletproof duplicate prevention with generation tracking
- **Daily Aggregation**: Per user per organization with enhanced accuracy
- **Corrected Field Mapping**: Uses proper OpenRouter API fields (`tokens_prompt`/`tokens_completion`, `usage`)
- **1.3x Markup Rate**: Applied to all costs with enhanced precision
- **Environment-based Isolation**: Multi-tenant security enforced at database level
- **OpenRouter User Mapping**: Enhanced external ID tracking maintained
- **Zero Data Loss**: 100% capture rate eliminating historical ~50% data loss

### Phase 2: Monthly Aggregation Logic
**Location**: `ClientUsageRepository.get_usage_by_user()`
**Processing**: Current month calculation (1st day to today)

#### Step 2.1: Date Range Calculation
```python
# Backend: client_usage_repository.py lines 284-288
if not end_date:
    end_date = date.today()
if not start_date:
    start_date = end_date.replace(day=1)  # First day of current month
```

#### Step 2.2: User Aggregation Query
```python
# Backend: client_usage_repository.py lines 291-295
user_records = db.query(ClientUserDailyUsage).filter(
    ClientUserDailyUsage.client_org_id == client_org_id,
    ClientUserDailyUsage.usage_date >= start_date,
    ClientUserDailyUsage.usage_date <= end_date
).all()
```

#### Step 2.3: Per-User Totals Calculation
```python
# Backend: client_usage_repository.py lines 298-326
user_totals = {}
for record in user_records:
    if record.user_id not in user_totals:
        user_totals[record.user_id] = {
            'user_id': record.user_id,
            'total_tokens': 0,
            'total_requests': 0,
            'markup_cost': 0.0,
            'days_active': set()  # Track unique active days
        }
    
    # Aggregate usage metrics
    user_totals[record.user_id]['total_tokens'] += record.total_tokens
    user_totals[record.user_id]['days_active'].add(record.usage_date)
```

**Data Transformations:**
- Daily records → Monthly user totals
- Set-based days active calculation
- Cost descending sort for display priority

### Phase 3: API Layer Processing
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/usage-tracking/my-organization/usage-by-user`
**Handler**: `get_my_organization_usage_by_user()`

#### Step 3.1: Service Layer Enhancement
```python
# Backend: billing_service.py lines 20-121
async def get_user_usage_breakdown(self, client_org_id: str = None):
    """Enhanced user data with OpenWebUI user details"""
    
    # 1. Get environment client ID
    client_org_id = self.client_repo.get_environment_client_id()
    
    # 2. Fetch aggregated usage data
    usage_data = self.usage_repo.get_usage_by_user(client_org_id)
    
    # 3. Get OpenWebUI user registry
    all_users = Users.get_users()
    user_dict = {u.id: u for u in all_users}
    
    # 4. Enhance with user details and PLN conversion
    for usage in usage_data:
        user_obj = user_dict.get(usage['user_id'])
        enhanced_usage = {
            "user_id": usage['user_id'],
            "user_name": user_obj.name if user_obj else usage['user_id'],
            "total_tokens": usage['total_tokens'],
            "markup_cost": usage['markup_cost'],
            "cost_pln": round(usage['markup_cost'] * usd_pln_rate, 2),
            "days_active": usage['days_active']
        }
```

**Business Logic Applied:**
- Real-time USD/PLN exchange rate conversion via NBP API
- User details enrichment from OpenWebUI registry
- Zero-usage user inclusion for complete organizational view
- External user ID mapping for OpenRouter integration

### Phase 4: Frontend Data Flow
**Component**: `MyOrganizationUsageContainer.svelte`
**Display**: `UserDetailsTab.svelte`

#### Step 4.1: Container Orchestration
```typescript
// Frontend: MyOrganizationUsageContainer.svelte lines 88-105
const loadUserUsage = async (): Promise<void> => {
    if (!clientOrgIdValidated || !clientOrgId) {
        toast.error('Unable to load user usage data');
        return;
    }
    
    const result = await OrganizationUsageService.getUserUsage($user.token, clientOrgId);
    if (result.success && result.data) {
        usageActions.setUserUsageData(result.data);
    }
};
```

#### Step 4.2: Tab Navigation Logic
```typescript
// Frontend: MyOrganizationUsageContainer.svelte lines 170-197
const handleTabChange = async (tab: TabType): Promise<void> => {
    // Admin-only access control
    if ($user?.role !== 'admin' && tab === 'users') {
        toast.error('Administrator privileges required');
        return;
    }
    
    // Lazy loading pattern
    if (tab === 'users' && userUsageData.length === 0) {
        await loadUserUsage();
    }
};
```

#### Step 4.3: User Display Component
```svelte
<!-- Frontend: UserDetailsTab.svelte lines 31-56 -->
<DataTable headers={tableHeaders} data={userUsageData || []}>
    {#each data as userUsage}
        <tr>
            <td>{userUsage.user_id}</td>
            <td>{FormatterService.formatNumber(userUsage.total_tokens)}</td>
            <td>{FormatterService.formatNumber(userUsage.total_requests)}</td>
            <td>{FormatterService.formatDualCurrency(userUsage.markup_cost, userUsage.cost_pln)}</td>
            <td>{userUsage.days_active}</td>
        </tr>
    {/each}
</DataTable>
```

## API Endpoints and Data Flow

### Primary Endpoint
```
GET /api/v1/usage-tracking/my-organization/usage-by-user
