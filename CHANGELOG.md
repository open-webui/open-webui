## [0.8.2] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- 🧠 **Skill content handling.** User-selected skills now have their full content injected into the chat, while model-attached skills only display name and description in the available skills list. This allows users to override skill behavior while model-attached skills remain flexible. [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/393c0071dc612c5ac982fb37dfc0288cb9911439)
- ⚙️ **Chat toggles now control built-in tools.** Users can now disable web search, image generation, and code execution on a per-conversation basis, even when those tools are enabled as builtin tools on the model. [#20641](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues/20641), [#21318](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/21318), [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/c46ef3b63bcc1e2e9adbdd18fab82c4bbe33ff6c), [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/f1a1e64d2e9ad953b2bc2a9543e9a308b7c669c8)
- 🖼️ **Image preview in file modal.** Images uploaded to chats can now be previewed directly in the file management modal, making it easier to identify and manage image files. [#21413](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues/21413), [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/e1b3e7252c1896c04d498547908f0fce111434e1)
- 🏷️ **Batch tag operations.** Tag creation, deletion, and orphan cleanup for chats now use batch database queries instead of per-tag loops, significantly reducing database round trips when updating, archiving, or deleting chats with multiple tags. [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/c748c3ede)
- 💨 **Faster group list loading.** Group lists and search results now load with a single database query that joins member counts, replacing the previous pattern of fetching groups first and then counting members in a separate batch query. [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/33308022f)
- 🔐 **Skills sharing permissions.** Administrators can now control skills sharing and public sharing permissions per-group, matching the existing capabilities for tools, knowledge, and prompts. [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/88401e91c)
- ⚡ **Long content truncation in preview modals.** Citation and file content modals now truncate markdown-rendered content at 10,000 characters with a "Show all" expansion button, preventing UI jank when previewing very large documents.
- 🌐 **Translation updates.** Translations for Spanish and German were enhanced and expanded.

### Fixed

- 🔐 **OAuth session error handling.** Corrupted OAuth sessions are now gracefully handled and automatically cleaned up instead of causing errors. [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/7e224e4a536b07ec008613f06592e34050e7067c)
- 🐛 **Task model selector validation.** The task model selector in admin settings now correctly accepts models based on the new access grants system instead of rejecting all models with an incorrect error. [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/9a2595f0706d0c9d809ae7746001cf799f98db1d)
- 🔗 **Tool call message preservation.** Models no longer hallucinate tool outputs in multi-turn conversations because tool call history is now properly preserved instead of being merged into assistant messages. [#21098](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/21098), [#20600](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues/20600), [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/f2aca781c87244cffc130aa2722e700c19a81d66)
- 🔧 **Tool server startup initialization.** External tool servers configured via the "TOOL_SERVER_CONNECTIONS" environment variable now initialize automatically on startup, eliminating the need to manually visit the Admin Panel and save for tools to become available. This enables proper GitOps and containerized deployments. [#18140](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues/18140), [#20914](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/pull/20914), [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/f20cc6d7e6da493eb75ca1618f5cbd068fa57684)
- ♻️ **Resource handle cleanup.** File handles are now properly closed during audio transcription and pipeline uploads, preventing resource leaks that could cause system instability over time. [#21411](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues/21411)
- ⌨️ **Strikethrough shortcut conflict fix.** Pressing Ctrl+Shift+S to toggle the sidebar no longer causes text to become struck through in the chat input, by disabling the TipTap Strike extension's default keyboard shortcut when rich text mode is off. [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/38ae91ae2)
- 🔧 **Tool call finish_reason fix.** API responses now correctly set finish_reason to "tool_calls" instead of "stop" when tool calls are present, fixing an issue where external API clients (such as OpenCode) would halt prematurely after tool execution when routing Ollama models through the Open WebUI API. [#20896](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/issues/20896)

## [0.8.1] - 2026-02-14

### Changed

- ⚠️ **Database Migrations:** This release includes database schema changes; we strongly recommend backing up your database and all associated data before upgrading in production environments. If you are running a multi-worker, multi-server, or load-balanced deployment, all instances must be updated simultaneously, rolling updates are not supported and will cause application failures due to schema incompatibility.

### Changed

- ‼️ **Database Migration Required** — This release includes database schema changes; multi-worker, multi-server, or load-balanced deployments must update all instances simultaneously rather than performing rolling updates, as running mixed versions will cause application failures due to schema incompatibility between old and new instances.
- ⚠️ **Chat Message Table Migration** — This release includes a new chat message table migration that can take a significant amount of time to complete in larger deployments with extensive chat histories. Administrators should plan for adequate maintenance windows and allow the migration to complete fully without interruption. Running the migration with insufficient time or resources may result in data integrity issues.

### Changed

- ⚠️ This release includes a major overhaul of database connection handling in the backend that requires all instances in multi-worker, multi-server, or load-balanced deployments to be updated simultaneously; running mixed versions will cause failures due to incompatible database connection management between old and new instances.
- 📝 Administrators who previously used the standalone "Markdown (Header)" text splitter must now switch to "character" or "token" mode with the new "ENABLE_MARKDOWN_HEADER_TEXT_SPLITTER" toggle enabled, as document chunking now applies markdown header splitting as a preprocessing step before character or token splitting.

- 🔐 Scripts or integrations that directly called Image Generation, Web Search, or Audio APIs while those features were disabled in the Admin UI will now receive 403 Forbidden errors, as backend permission enforcement has been added to match frontend restrictions. [#20471](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/pull/20471)
- 👥 The default group sharing permission changed from "Members" to "Anyone", meaning users can now share content to any group configured with "Anyone" permission regardless of their membership in that group.

### Changed

- ⚠️ This release includes database schema changes; multi-worker, multi-server, or load-balanced deployments must update all instances simultaneously rather than performing rolling updates, as running mixed versions will cause application failures due to schema incompatibility between old and new instances.
- 📡 WEB_SEARCH_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS default changed from 10 to 0 (unlimited) — This setting now applies to all search engines instead of only DuckDuckGo; previously users were implicitly limited to 10 concurrent queries, but now have unlimited parallel requests by default; set to 1 for sequential execution if using rate-limited APIs like Brave free tier. [#20070](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/pull/20070)
- 💾 SQLCipher absolute path handling was fixed to properly support absolute database paths (e.g., "/app/data.db") instead of incorrectly stripping leading slashes and converting them to relative paths; this restores functionality for Docker volume mounts and explicit absolute path configurations while maintaining backward compatibility with relative paths. [#20074](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/pull/20074)
- 🔌 Knowledge base file listing API was redesigned with paginated responses and new filtering parameters; the GET /knowledge/{id}/files endpoint now returns paginated results with user attribution instead of embedding all files in the knowledge object, which may require updates to custom integrations or scripts accessing knowledge base data programmatically. [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/commit/94a8439105f30203ea9d729787c9c5978f5c22a2)

### Changed

- 🛠️ Renamed "Tools" to "External Tools" across the UI for clearer distinction between built-in and external functionalities. [Commit](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/pull/17070/commits/0bca4e230ef276bec468889e3be036242ad11086f)
- 🛡️ Default permission validation for message regeneration and deletion actions is enhanced to provide more restrictive access controls, improving chat security and user data protection. [#17285](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/pull/17285)

## [0.6.26] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- 🛂 **Granular Chat Interaction Permissions**: Added fine-grained permission controls for individual chat actions including "Continue Response", "Regenerate Response", "Rate Response", and "Delete Messages". Administrators can now configure these permissions per user group or set system defaults via environment variables, providing enhanced security and governance by preventing potential system prompt leakage through response continuation and enabling precise control over user interactions with AI responses.
- 🧠 **Custom Reasoning Tags Configuration**: Added configurable reasoning tag detection for AI model responses, allowing administrators and users to customize how the system identifies and processes reasoning content. Users can now define custom reasoning tag pairs, use default tags like "think" and "reasoning", or disable reasoning detection entirely through the Advanced Parameters interface, providing enhanced control over AI thought process visibility.
- 📱 **Pull-to-Refresh Support**: Added pull-to-refresh functionality allowing user to easily refresh the interface by pulling down on the navbar area. This resolves timeout issues that occurred when temporarily switching away from the app during long AI response generations, eliminating the need to close and relaunch the PWA.
- 📁 **Configurable File Upload Processing Mode**: Added "process_in_background" query parameter to the file upload API endpoint, allowing clients to choose between asynchronous (default) and synchronous file processing. Setting "process_in_background=false" forces the upload request to wait until extraction and embedding complete, returning immediately usable files and simplifying integration for backend API consumers that prefer blocking calls over polling workflows.
- 🔐 **Azure Document Intelligence DefaultAzureCredential Support**: Added support for authenticating with Azure Document Intelligence using DefaultAzureCredential in addition to API key authentication, enabling seamless integration with Azure Entra ID and managed identity authentication for enterprise Azure environments.
- 🔐 **Authentication Bootstrapping Enhancements**: Added "ENABLE_INITIAL_ADMIN_SIGNUP" environment variable and "?form=true" URL parameter to enable initial admin user creation and forced login form display in SSO-only deployments. This resolves bootstrap issues where administrators couldn't create the first user when login forms were disabled, allowing proper initialization of SSO-configured deployments without requiring temporary configuration changes.
- ⚡ **Query Generation Caching**: Added "ENABLE_QUERIES_CACHE" environment variable to enable request-scoped caching of generated search queries. When both web search and file retrieval are active, queries generated for web search are automatically reused for file retrieval, eliminating duplicate LLM API calls and reducing token usage and costs while maintaining search quality.
- 🔧 **Configurable Tool Call Retry Limit**: Added "CHAT_RESPONSE_MAX_TOOL_CALL_RETRIES" environment variable to control the maximum number of sequential tool calls allowed before safety stopping a chat session. This replaces the previous hardcoded limit of 10, enabling administrators to configure higher limits for complex workflows requiring extensive tool interactions.
- 📦 **Slim Docker Image Variant**: Added new slim Docker image option via "USE_SLIM" build argument that excludes embedded AI models and Ollama installation, reducing image size by approximately 1GB. This variant enables faster image pulls and deployments for environments where AI models are managed externally, particularly beneficial for auto-scaling clusters and distributed deployments.
- 🗂️ **Shift-to-Delete Functionality for Workspace Prompts**: Added keyboard shortcut support for quick prompt deletion on the Workspace Prompts page. Hold Shift and hover over any prompt to reveal a trash icon for instant deletion, bringing consistent interaction patterns across all workspace sections (Models, Tools, Functions, and now Prompts) and streamlining prompt management workflows.
- ♿ **Accessibility Enhancements**: Enhanced user interface accessibility with improved keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader compatibility across key platform components.
- 📄 **Optimized PDF Export for Smaller File Size**: PDF exports are now significantly optimized, producing much smaller files for faster downloads and easier sharing or archiving of your chats and documents.
- 📦 **Slimmed Default Install with Optional Full Dependencies**: Installing Open WebUI via pip now defaults to a slimmer package; PostgreSQL support is no longer included by default—simply use 'pip install open-webui[all]' to include all optional dependencies for full feature compatibility.
- 🔄 **General Backend Refactoring**: Implemented various backend improvements to enhance performance, stability, and security, ensuring a more resilient and reliable platform for all users.
- 🌐 **Localization & Internationalization Improvements**: Enhanced and expanded translations for Finnish, Spanish, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), and Chinese, including missing translations and typo corrections, providing a more natural and professional user experience for speakers of these languages across the entire interface.

### Fixed

- ⚠️ **Chat Error Feedback Restored**: Fixed an issue where various backend errors (tool server failures, API connection issues, malformed responses) would cause chats to load indefinitely without providing user feedback. The system now properly displays error messages when failures occur during chat generation, allowing users to understand issues and retry as needed instead of waiting indefinitely.
- 🖼️ **Image Generation Steps Setting Visibility Fixed**: Fixed a UI issue where the "Set Steps" configuration option was incorrectly displayed for OpenAI and Gemini image generation engines that don't support this parameter. The setting is now only visible for compatible engines like ComfyUI and Automatic1111, eliminating user confusion about non-functional configuration options.
- 📄 **Datalab Marker API Document Loader Fixed**: Fixed broken Datalab Marker API document loader functionality by correcting URL path handling for both hosted Datalab services and self-hosted Marker servers. Removed hardcoded "/marker" paths from the loader code and restored proper default URL structure, ensuring PDF and document processing works correctly with both deployment types.
- 📋 **Citation Error Handling Improved**: Fixed an issue where malformed citation or source objects from external tools, pipes, or filters would cause JavaScript errors and make the chat interface completely unresponsive. The system now gracefully handles missing or undefined citation properties, allowing conversations to load properly even when tools generate defective citation events.
- 👥 **Group User Add API Endpoint Fixed**: Fixed an issue where the "/api/v1/groups/id/{group_id}/users/add" API endpoint would accept requests without errors but fail to actually add users to groups. The system now properly initializes and deduplicates user ID lists, ensuring users are correctly added to and removed from groups via API calls.
